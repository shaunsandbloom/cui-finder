NASA,"NASA FUTURE MISSIONS PLACE STRINGENT REQUIREMENTS ON HIGH TEMPERATURE AND LIGHT-WEIGHT MATERIALS.THIS PROPOSAL ADDRESSES SOME OF THE MOST CHALLENGING MATERIALS ISSUES WITH RESPECT TO HOT STRUCTURES, VERY HIGH TEMPERATURE, UP TO 4500 DEGREES F, APPLICATIONS. THE VERY SUCCESSFUL NASA LED X-43A HYPERSONIC FLIGHT PROVED THE ABILITY TO USE STATE OF THE ART (SOTA) 2D C-C WITH OXIDATION COATING SYSTEM. HOWEVER, CURRENT MATERIAL SYSTEMS CAN ONLY OFFER LIMITED TEMPERATURE CAPABILITY (&LT;3000  F) AND MOSTLY FOR SINGLE USE APPLICATION. IN PHASE I, TWO INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES, UNDERCOAT AND FGM MULTI-LAYER COATS, WERE DEVELOPED AND SCREENED. THEY WERE FURTHER INTEGRATED INTO TWO SOTA C-C COMPOSITES. OXIDATION PROTECTED C-C SAMPLES WERE TORCH TESTED AT 3500 F/ 30 MINUTES, AT 4200 F/ 2 MINUTES UP TO 10 CYCLES, AND AT 3000 F/COOL/ 4000 F CYCLES SHOWING VERY PROMISING RESULTS. THE COMBINED EFFECTS OF THE UNDERCOAT AND FGM SPRAY COATS PROVIDE REPEATABLE PERFORMANCE BY CREATING A GLASS FORMING, CONFORMING AND ADHERENT EXTERNAL COATING TO PROTECT THE C-C FROM BEING OXIDIZED. THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF THE PROPOSED P-II IS TO FURTHER DEVELOP AND OPTIMIZE A ROBUST, TAILORABLE, AND AFFORDABLE OXIDATION PROTECTION SYSTEM FOR C-C TPS AND C-C HOT STRUCTURE BY INTEGRATING OUR UNDERCOAT AND FGM MULTI-LAYER SPRAY COAT TECHNOLOGIES INTO AT LEAST TWO GRADES C-C COMPOSITES (T300 AND P30 2D C-C) MEETING HIGHER TEMPERATURE PERFORMANCE UP TO 4500 F AND MULTI-USE APPLICATIONS. WORK PLAN INCLUDES 12 TASKS OVER 24 MONTH GROUPED INTO 5 CATEGORIES. ONCE FURTHER OPTIMIZED AND VALIDATED UNDER PHASE II, THESE TECHNOLOGIES CAN EASILY BE INTEGRATED INTO SOTA C-C USING CURRENT MANUFACTURING FACILITIES. THE RESULTING OXIDATION PROTECTED C-C COULD BE TAILORABLE, AFFORDABLE, AND EASILY SCALED UP FOR LARGE COMPONENTS OR STRUCTURE REQUIRED IN FUTURE NASA, DOD AND COMMERCIAL SPACE APPLICATIONS.",1875,,,,
NASA,"THERE IS A DISCONNECT BETWEEN THE MISSION OPERATION LANGUAGES USED BY VARIOUS NASA ROBOTS AND BY FLIGHT CONTROLLERS OR CREW MEMBERS. THIS DISCONNECT UNDULY BURDENS MISSION OPERATORS, AS IT REQUIRES THE INVOLVEMENT OF EXPERT ROBOT PROGRAMMERS TO DEFINE EACH ACTIVITY. TO ELIMINATE THIS BURDEN, WE PROPOSE THAT ROBOTS IN SPACE (WHETHER AUTONOMOUS OR REMOTELY COMMANDED BY HUMANS) SHOULD BE COMMANDED USING VERIFIED, HUMAN-READABLE PROCEDURES. SUCH AN APPROACH WILL ALLOW NASA TO SEAMLESSLY ALLOCATE NEW ROBOTIC CAPABILITIES AND RESOURCES TO EXISTING SPACE ACTIVITIES, AND WILL FACILITATE THE COOPERATION OF HUMANS AND THEIR ROBOT ASSISTANTS WHEN PERFORMING JOINT ACTIVITIES. IN PHASE I OF THIS WORK, PROGRESS TOWARDS THIS GOAL WAS DEMONSTRATED BY COMBINING TWO PREVIOUSLY DISPARATE SOFTWARE SUITES. TRACLABS' PROCEDURE IDE FOR AUTHORING AND RUNNING ELECTRONIC PROCEDURES AND OUR CRAFTSMAN MOBILE MANIPULATION PLANNING AND CONTROL SOFTWARE HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS IN CONJUNCTION WITH NASA ENGINEERS AND RESEARCHERS ON VARIOUS PROJECTS. THE INTEGRATION OF THESE TWO RESEARCH STREAMS IN THIS PHARAOH (PROCEDURE-HANDLING ARCHITECTURE FOR ROBOTS AND/OR HUMANS) SYSTEM HAS DEMONSTRATED THE PROMISE OF OUR APPROACH, WHILE ALSO HIGHLIGHTING DEFICIENCIES IN THE CURRENT ELECTRONIC PROCEDURE SOFTWARE AS IT PERTAINS TO COMMAND AND CONTROL OF COMPLICATED REMOTE ROBOTS. IN PHASE II, WE WILL BUILD UPON LESSONS LEARNED TO REPLACE, IMPROVE, AND VALIDATE VARIOUS ARCHITECTURAL, OPERATIONAL, AND COMPUTATIONAL COMPONENTS OF THE PHASE I PROTOTYPE.

THIS SBIR PHASE II PROJECT WILL COMMERCIALIZE A ROBUST CRYOGEN-FREE PRE-CONCENTRATOR BASED ON A STIRLING CRYOCOOLER AND A NOVEL SAMPLE TRAP DESIGN. THIS SYSTEM WAS SUCCESSFULLY DEMONSTRATED IN PHASE I TO HAVE BETTER THERMAL PERFORMANCE WITH LOWER MAINTENANCE THAN CURRENT PRE-CONCENTRATION SYSTEMS USED IN NASA PROGRAMS. THE NEW SAMPLE TRAPS ARE BACKWARD COMPATIBLE WITH THE EXISTING CRYOGENIC SYSTEM TO PROVIDE CONTINUED SUPPORT FOR RESEARCH GROUPS USING PRE-CONCENTRATORS WITH LESS ADVANCED COOLING. IN PHASE II, ALTERNATIVE SAMPLE TRAPS WILL BE DEVELOPED TO EXPAND THE UTILITY OF THE PRE-CONCENTRATOR TO A BROADER SET OF ATMOSPHERIC TRACE GASES, AND TO ENHANCE THE SENSITIVITY OF OPTICAL-BASED ISOTOPIC MEASUREMENTS. SELECTIVE AND SENSITIVE DETECTION OF GREENHOUSE GASES AND OZONE DEPLETING SUBSTANCES WILL BE FURTHER ENHANCED BY COUPLING THE PRE-CONCENTRATOR, VIA A GAS CHROMATOGRAPH, TO THE HIGH RESOLUTION TIME-OF-FLIGHT MASS SPECTROMETER SYSTEM EVALUATED IN PHASE I.

NASA,"THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP AN OFFSET-FED PARABOLOIDAL MESH REFLECTOR ANTENNA FOR OPERATION ONBOARD SMALL, LOW COST SATELLITES SUCH AS CUBESATS, IN THE FREQUENCY RANGE UP TO 100 GHZ. THE PHASE II COMPONENT OF THIS GOAL IS TO FULLY TEST THE PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS OF A PROTOTYPE DEPLOYABLE ANTENNA REFLECTOR, WITH AN APERTURE GREATER THAN 0.5 M UNDER CONTROLLED CONDITIONS. THE MESH USED IN THE REFLECTOR IS GOLD PLATED MOLYBDENUM. THE WEAVE OF THE MESH WILL BE DEVELOPED EARLY IN PHASE II TO ACHIEVE THE TIGHT TOLERANCES REQUIRED FOR OPERATION UP TO 100 GHZ (W-BAND). CHARACTERIZATION MEASUREMENTS OF THE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE MESH HAVE BEEN COMPLETED AND WILL BE USED AS A BASELINE TO QUANTIFY IMPROVEMENTS MEASURED FROM THE NEWLY DEVELOPED MESH SAMPLES. ANALYSIS OF SURFACE ERROR CONTRIBUTIONS FROM FACETING, THERMAL STRESSES, MANUFACTURING TOLERANCES, AND OPERATIONAL FORCES WILL BE PERFORMED. MICRO-MACHINING AND SMALL-SCALE MANUFACTURING TECHNIQUES WILL BE REFINED TO ACHIEVE AN OVERALL REFLECTOR SURFACE ACCURACY OF LESS THAN 60 MICROMETERS (1/50 OF THE WAVELENGTH AT 100 GHZ). THE FULLY CONSTRUCTED MESH REFLECTOR ANTENNA WITH FEED WILL BE MEASURED TO OBTAIN THE FULL GAIN PATTERN OF THE ANTENNA TO CHARACTERIZE THE ANTENNA PERFORMANCE AND DETERMINE THE OVERALL EFFICIENCY OF THE MESH REFLECTOR. THE DEPLOYMENT MECHANISM WILL ALSO BE TESTED AND REFINED TO ENSURE REPEATABLE OPERATION OF THE ANTENNA. THE PROPOSED ANTENNA CAN BE STOWED WITHIN LESS THAN 1.5 U OF A CUBESAT. DOING SO CAN SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THE COST OF ANY SATELLITE SYSTEM REQUIRING A HIGH GAIN REFLECTOR ANTENNA, INCLUDING RADARS, SCATTEROMETERS, RADIOMETERS, AND DEEP SPACE COMMUNICATION LINKS.

NASA,"THE OVERALL GOAL OF NASA'S FUNDAMENTAL AERONAUTICS PROGRAM HIGH SPEED PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP AND VALIDATE THE TOOLS, TECHNOLOGIES, AND CONCEPTS TO OVERCOME THE BARRIERS TO PRACTICAL HIGH-SPEED VEHICLES. FOR THE 2013 - 2017 TIME PERIOD, THE HIGH SPEED PROJECT HAS PLACED A PRIORITY ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF TOOLS AND INTEGRATED CONCEPTS THAT WILL ENABLE DEMONSTRATION OF OVERLAND SUPERSONIC FLIGHT WITH AN ACCEPTABLE SONIC BOOM. TWO OF THE HIGH SPEED PROJECT S TECHNICAL CHALLENGES IN THIS TIME FRAME RELATE TO THIS PRIORITY. THEY ARE LOW SONIC BOOM DESIGN TOOLS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF SONIC BOOM COMMUNITY RESPONSE METRICS AND METHODOLOGIES. THE HIGH SPEED PROJECT ALSO HAS A TECHNICAL CHALLENGE OF ACHIEVING ACCEPTABLE AIRPORT COMMUNITY NOISE. IN ADDITION TO THESE NEAR-TERM TECHNICAL CHALLENGES, THE HIGH SPEED PROJECT CONTINUES TO INVEST IN LONGER-TERM RESEARCH ON OTHER BARRIERS TO HIGH-SPEED AIRCRAFT SUCH AS HIGH ALTITUDE EMISSIONS, CRUISE EFFICIENCY, AEROSERVOELASTICITY, FLIGHT SYSTEMS, AND SCRAMJET PROPULSION.  THE SELECTION OF THE TECHNICAL CHALLENGES DESCRIBED ABOVE WAS BASED ON THE SUCCESSFUL RESEARCH CONDUCTED OVER THE PREVIOUS SEVERAL YEARS IN THE FUNDAMENTAL AERONAUTICS SUPERSONICS PROJECT. ALTHOUGH BROADER IN OVERALL SCOPE THAN THE HIGH SPEED PROJECT, THE SUPERSONICS PROJECT ALSO CONTAINED ELEMENTS THAT FOCUSED ON LOW SONIC BOOM DESIGN AND SONIC BOOM COMMUNITY RESPONSE. THIS WORK CULMINATED IN THE 2009 AWARD OF THE N+2 SYSTEMS VALIDATION CONTRACTS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THESE NASA RESEARCH ANNOUNCEMENT (NRA)-FUNDED EFFORTS WAS TO EVALUATE TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES FOR SUPERSONIC CIVIL AIRCRAFT DESIGN. THE STUDIES HAVE HELPED VALIDATE THESE TOOL SETS AND TECHNOLOGIES THROUGH SUCCESSFUL WIND TUNNEL TESTING OF SCALE MODELS.  THE NEXT CRITICAL STEPS IN OVERCOMING THE BARRIER TO OVERLAND SUPERSONIC FLIGHT ARE FLIGHT VALIDATION OF THESE TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES COUPLED WITH COMMUNITY OVERFLIGHT STUDIES THAT WILL PROVIDE DATA TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NOISE-BASED REGULATORY STANDARD TO REPLACE THE CURRENT PROHIBITION OF CIVIL OVERLAND SUPERSONIC FLIGHT. BASED ON THE RECENT SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS, NASA IS EXAMINING THE POSSIBILITY OF CONDUCTING SUCH A FLIGHT DEMONSTRATION. FOR THIS REASON, THE HIGH SPEED PROJECT HAS BEEN DIRECTED TO FOCUS ON ENSURING THE READINESS OF LOW-BOOM DESIGN TOOLS FOR APPLICATION IN A MANNED FLIGHT DEMONSTRATION PROJECT AND ON THE VALIDATION OF FIELD STUDY METHODOLOGIES, SURVEY TOOLS, AND TEST PROTOCOLS REQUIRED TO SUPPORT COMMUNITY OVERFLIGHT STUDIES AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.  THE HIGH SPEED PROJECT HAS ALSO BEEN TASKED WITH CONDUCTING CONCEPT STUDIES AND RESEARCH THAT WILL INFORM A FUTURE DECISION PROCESS REGARDING A POTENTIAL FLIGHT DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM INCLUDING THE DEVELOPMENT AND DEFINITION OF PROGRAMMATIC, TECHNICAL, AND COST REQUIREMENTS FOR A LOW-BOOM FLIGHT DEMONSTRATION (LBFD) PROJECT. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVES OF THE LBFD PROJECT WILL BE FLIGHT VALIDATION OF DESIGN TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES APPLICABLE TO LOW SONIC BOOM AIRCRAFT AND THE CREATION OF COMMUNITY RESPONSE DATA THAT WILL SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NOISE-BASED STANDARD FOR SUPERSONIC OVERLAND FLIGHT.  THE INTENT OF THIS TASK ORDER IS TO CONDUCT A LBFD CONCEPT FORMULATION STUDY. FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS LBFD CONCEPT FORMULATION STUDY, THE LBFD PROJECT IS ENVISIONED AS THREE DISTINCT PHASES. PHASE 1 WILL INCLUDE ALL REQUIRED LBFD AIRCRAFT DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES FROM SYSTEM DEFINITION AND PRELIMINARY DESIGN THROUGH FABRICATION, CHECKOUT, AND FIRST FLIGHT THROUGH SUPERSONIC ENVELOPE EXPANSION. PHASE 1 IS EXPECTED TO INCLUDE MINIMAL TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT AND NOT EXCEED 5 YEARS IN DURATION. PHASE 2 WILL TRANSITION FROM ENVELOPE EXPANSION TO LOW-BOOM SIGNATURE VALIDATION FLIGHTS OVER AN INSTRUMENTED TEST RANGE. THE FINAL PHASE 3 WILL ENCOMPASS LOW SONIC BOOM COMMUNITY OVERFLIGHT STUDIES AT VARIOUS COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE UNITED STATES AND POTENTIALLY SELECTED INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITIES. THIS SOW IS PRIMARILY DIRECTED AT THE INITIAL FORMULATION AN",3979,,,,
NASA,"""REVERSE-BIASED ACCELERATED LIFE TESTING OF 10UF CAPACITORS FOR ELC LVPS"" - THE NASA ENGINEERING AND SAFETY CENTER (NESC) IS AN INDEPENDENT ORGANIZATION FOCUSED ON ENGINEERING EXCELLENCE.  THE OBJECTIVE OF THE NESC IS TO IMPROVE SAFETY BY PERFORMING IN-DEPTH INDEPENDENT ENGINEERING ASSESSMENTS, TESTING, AND ANALYSIS TO UNCOVER TECHNICAL VULNERABILITIES AND TO DETERMINE APPROPRIATE PREVENTATIVE AND CORRECTIVE ACTIONS FOR PROBLEMS, TRENDS, OR ISSUES WITHIN NASA'S PROGRAMS, PROJECTS, AND INSTITUTIONS.  THE NESC DRAWS UPON THE BEST ENGINEERING EXPERTISE FROM ACROSS THE AGENCY AND INCLUDES PARTNERSHIPS WITH OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, NATIONAL LABORATORIES, UNIVERSITIES, AND INDUSTRY.  BY DRAWING ON THE MINDS OF LEADING ENGINEERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY, NESC CONSISTENTLY OPTIMIZES ITS PROCESSES, DEEPENS ITS KNOWLEDGE BASE, STRENGTHENS ITS TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES, AND BROADENS ITS PERSPECTIVES, THEREBY FURTHER EXECUTING ITS COMMITMENT TO ENGINEERING EXCELLENCE. NESC'S ORGANIZATIONAL MODEL IS FOUNDED ON A KNOWLEDGE BASE OF TECHNICAL EXPERTISE DERIVED FROM WITHIN ALL NASA CENTERS AND AMONG A GROUP OF PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS EXTERNAL TO THE AGENCY.  FOR EACH TECHNICAL ASSESSMENT THAT IS CONDUCTED, NESC ACCESSES A READY GROUP OF ENGINEERING EXPERTS - CALLED TECHNICAL DISCIPLINE TEAMS (TDTS) FROM MULTIPLE DISCIPLINE AREAS.  THESE TEAMS, WHICH ARE LED BY NASA TECHNICAL FELLOWS, WORK TOGETHER TO ENSURE THAT THE HIGHEST STANDARD OF ENGINEERING EXCELLENCE IS ACHIEVED.  THE NESC HAS BEEN REQUESTED TO INVESTIGATE THE FAILURE OF THE EXPRESS PALLET CONTROLLER ASSEMBLY SIMULATOR (ALSO KNOWN AS THE ELC SIMULATOR), DISCOVERED DURING CHECKOUT FOR THE SPACE TEST PROGRAM HOUSTON 4 (STP-H4) PAYLOAD ON-GROUND TESTING AT KENNEDY SPACE CENTER (KSC) IN OCTOBER 2012. THIS ASSESSMENT WILL EVALUATE THE ELECTRICAL GROUND SUPPORT EQUIPMENT SIMULATOR AND THE FLIGHT BUILD OF THE GODDARD SPACE FLIGHT CENTER (GSFC)-PRODUCED ELC EXPERIMENT CONTROL MODULE (ECM).  THE INITIAL INVESTIGATION AND TROUBLESHOOTING REVEALED THAT THE IMMEDIATE CAUSE OF THE FAILURE WAS DUE TO THE LOW-VOLTAGE POWER SUPPLY (LVPS) IN THE ECM. INITIAL VISUAL INSPECTION INDICATED THAT THE FAILURE OF THE LVPS WAS DUE TO REVERSE POLARITY INSTALLATION OF TANTALUM CAPACITORS IN THE LVPS. ALSO, THE ANALYSIS SUGGESTED THAT THE CAPACITORS IN THE EXPRESS LOGISTICS CARRIER (ELC) FLIGHT LVPS UNITS MAY HAVE BEEN INSTALLED IN REVERSE POLARITY THUS, THE NESC HAS BEEN REQUESTED TO EVALUATE THE POSSIBLE IMPACT OF REVERSE POLARITY INSTALLATION ON THE LVPS FLIGHT UNITS AND POSSIBLE MITIGATION OF THE IMPACTS.",2558,,,,

NASA,"GAS CONDUCTION AND RADIATION ARE THE TWO IMPORTANT HEAT TRANSFER MECHANISMS IN HIGHLY POROUS REUSABLE THERMAL PROTECTION SYSTEMS USED FOR PLANETARY ENTRY OF SPACE VEHICLES. THE RELATIVE MAGNITUDE OF THE TWO VARIES DEPENDING ON ALTITUDE, TEMPERATURE AND THE PLANET. USUALLY RADIATION IS MORE SIGNIFICANT AT LOWER PRESSURES AND AT HIGHER TEMPERATURES. GAS CONDUCTION IS MORE DOMINANT AT HIGHER PRESSURES AND LOWER TEMPERATURES. IN MOST PLANETARY ENTRIES, BOTH MODES OF HEAT TRANSFER ARE SIGNIFICANT. TYPICAL FLEXIBLE OR RIGID REFRACTORY CERAMIC FIBER THERMAL PROTECTION SYSTEM (TPS) SUCH AS ADVANCED FLEXIBLE REUSABLE SURFACE INSULATION (AFRSI) AND SHUTTLE TILES CAN TAKE HIGH TEMPERATURES, CAN REDUCE GAS CONDUCTION AT LOWER PRESSURES, AND SCATTER RADIATION AT HIGHER TEMPERATURES. THERE IS A NEED FOR MORE EFFICIENT TPS WITH LOWER MASS, REDUCED THICKNESS AND SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY TO MAKE INTER PLANETARY MISSIONS POSSIBLE.

NASA,"TASK TITLE: ASSESSMENT OF THE STATE OF THE ART OF PROGRESSIVE DAMAGE ANALYSIS 1.0INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND: THE NASA ADVANCED COMPOSITES PROJECT (ACP) SEEKS TO DEVELOP AND TRANSITION TECHNOLOGY THAT WILL ENABLE REDUCTION IN THE TIMELINE REQUIRED FOR DEVELOPMENT AND CERTIFICATION OF NEW AIRCRAFT STRUCTURES THAT UTILIZE ADVANCED COMPOSITE MATERIALS.  HIGH FIDELITY ANALYSIS METHODS THAT CAN RELIABLY PREDICT THE ONSET OF DAMAGE AND DAMAGE PROGRESSION IN COMPOSITE MATERIALS CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THIS GOAL BY REPLACING SOME OF THE TESTING REQUIREMENTS IN THE BUILDING BLOCK APPROACH USED FOR THE DESIGN AND CERTIFICATION OF PRIMARY AIRCRAFT STRUCTURE.  ADDITIONALLY, THESE ANALYSIS METHODS OFFER THE POTENTIAL FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF MORE EFFICIENT STRUCTURAL CONCEPTS BY ENABLING THE EXPLORATION OF THE LARGE DESIGN SPACE OF LAMINATED COMPOSITES, WHICH IS NOT POSSIBLE WITH THE CURRENT LARGELY EMPIRICAL APPROACH FOR STRUCTURAL DESIGN AND SUBSTANTIATION.   WITH THIS GOAL IN MIND, NASA IS SEEKING TO DEVELOP, OR MATURE, NEW OR IMPROVED, PHYSICALLY ACCURATE, VERIFIED AND VALIDATED, HIGH FIDELITY PROGRESSIVE DAMAGE ANALYSIS (PDA) TOOLS FOR QUASI-STATIC, DYNAMIC AND FATIGUE LOADING CONDITIONS.  THESE HIGH FIDELITY TOOLS NEED TO BE COMPUTATIONALLY RIGOROUS, APPLICABLE TO STRUCTURAL LEVEL SIMULATIONS, AND CAPTURE NOT ONLY THE GLOBAL RESPONSE OF THE COMPONENT MODELED, BUT ALSO CAPTURE THE CORRECT FAILURE MODES AND INTERACTIONS, LOCATION, AND PROGRESSION OF DAMAGE AND THE ULTIMATE EFFECT OF DAMAGE PROGRESSION ON THE COMPONENT STRENGTH AND LIFE.  THE NASA ACP IS FOCUSING ON THREE CASE STUDIES FOR DEVELOPMENT AND VALIDATION OF ANALYSIS TOOLS:       (1)  STATIC CASE STUDY:  PREDICTIVE CAPABILITY FOR RESIDUAL DAMAGE TOLERANCE OF LOW-VELOCITY-IMPACT DAMAGED STRINGER-REINFORCED, POST-BUCKLED, THIN-SKIN COMPOSITE STRUCTURE  (2)  FATIGUE CASE STUDY:  PREDICTIVE CAPABILITY FOR FATIGUE LIFE OF DYNAMIC ROTOR COMPONENTS AND HIGHLY LOADED BOLTED JOINTS AND  (3)  DYNAMIC CASE STUDY:  PREDICTIVE CAPABILITY FOR CONTAINMENT OF ENGINE FAN BLADES SUBJECTED TO HIGH ENERGY IMPACTS.    CASE STUDIES (1) AND (2) WILL USE A GRAPHITE EPOXY PRE-IMPREGNATED TAPE MATERIAL ARCHITECTURE AND CASE STUDY (3) WILL USE A DRY WOVEN RESIN-INFUSED MATERIAL ARCHITECTURE OR AND A GRAPHITE EPOXY PRE-IMPREGNATED TAPE MATERIAL.  2.0  SCOPE&OBJECTIVES:  2.1 THE SCOPE OF THIS TASK ORDER IS TO ASSESS THE STATE OF THE ART (SOA) IN PROGRESSIVE DAMAGE ANALYSIS METHODOLOGIES AND TOOLS FOR THE CASE STUDIES STATED ABOVE.  OF PARTICULAR INTEREST TO NASA ARE THE DEVELOPMENTS REQUIRED TO ADVANCE THE DOWN-SELECTED METHODOLOGIES AND TOOLS TO A MATURITY LEVEL SUITABLE FOR INTEGRATION INTO AN AIRCRAFT CERTIFICATION PROCESS.   2.2 THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS TASK ORDER ARE TO:     IDENTIFY THE MOST PROMISING PDA METHODOLOGIES AND TOOLS FOR PREDICTING DAMAGE FORMATION, GROWTH, ACCUMULATION AND THE EFFECT ON STRENGTH AND LIFE FOR PRACTICAL APPLICATION.   IDENTIFY THE MATURITY OF THESE METHODOLOGIES AND TOOLS RELATIVE TO THEIR POTENTIAL TO BE CONSIDERED FOR USE IN A NEW PRODUCT CERTIFICATION EFFORT BY 2019 AND TO HAVE ACHIEVED A MATURITY LEVEL REQUIRED FOR AIRCRAFT CERTIFICATION BY 2024.   RECOMMEND THE SUBSET OF METHODOLOGIES AND TOOLS MOST PROMISING FOR FURTHER INVESTMENT BY THE NASA ACP.&#8195  3.0 DESCRIPTION OF THE WORK/TASKS TO BE PERFORMED:    3.1 PDA METHODOLOGY AND TOOL ASSESSMENT  THE CONTRACTOR SHALL PERFORM AN ASSESSMENT THAT SHALL:  - INCLUDE A SUMMARY OF CANDIDATE PREDICTION METHODOLOGIES RELEVANT TO EACH CASE STUDY, AND RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE MOST PROMISING METHODOLOGIES TO BE POTENTIALLY CARRIED FORWARD BY THE ACP FOR THOROUGH QUANTITATIVE EVALUATION AND FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT.  - ADDRESS THE THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS OF THE METHODOLOGY, AS WELL AS THE POTENTIAL FOR PRACTICAL APPLICATION AT THE STRUCTURAL LEVEL, AND SHALL INCLUDE SUFFICIENT DATA ON CANDIDATE CODES TO ENABLE SELECTION OF ANALYSIS CODES FOR FUTURE EVALUATION.   - RECOMMEND PDA METHODS/TOOLS THAT",3950,,,,

NASA,"TASK ORDER - STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW)  TASK TITLE:  REGULATORY COMPLIANCE IN MULTITIER SUPPLIER NETWORKS 1.0 INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND: AIRCRAFT CONSIST OF A COLLECTION OF SYSTEMS PERFORMING A WIDE VARIETY OF FUNCTIONS WITH DIFFERENT SAFETY CRITICALITY LEVELS.  FOR DECADES NOW, THERE HAS BEEN AN ONGOING TREND OF INCREASING ADOPTION OF EVER MORE SOPHISTICATED COMPUTER-BASED TECHNOLOGY TO REALIZE AIRCRAFT FUNCTIONALITY.  STATE-OF-THE-ART AIRCRAFT AVIONICS ARE HIGHLY COMPLEX, FUNCTIONALLY INTEGRATED, NETWORK-CENTRIC SYSTEMS OF SYSTEMS.  THE DESIGN AND ANALYSIS OF DISTRIBUTED-COMPUTATION SYSTEMS LIKE THE ONES USED ON AIRCRAFT ARE INHERENTLY COMPLEX ACTIVITIES.  ENSURING THAT SUCH SYSTEMS ARE SAFE AND COMPLY WITH EXISTING AIRWORTHINESS REGULATIONS IS COSTLY AND TIME-CONSUMING AS THE LEVEL OF RIGOR IN THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, ESPECIALLY THE VALIDATION AND VERIFICATION ACTIVITIES, IS DETERMINED BY CONSIDERATIONS OF SYSTEM COMPLEXITY AND SAFETY CRITICALITY.  A SIGNIFICANT DEGREE OF CARE AND DEEP INSIGHT INTO THE OPERATIONAL PRINCIPLES OF THESE SYSTEMS IS REQUIRED TO ENSURE ADEQUATE COVERAGE OF ALL DESIGN IMPLICATIONS RELEVANT TO SYSTEM SAFETY.    THE OVERALL COMPLEXITY OF MODERN AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS AND THE COMPLEX INTERACTIONS BETWEEN COMPONENTS (INCLUDING HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE COMPONENTS) IS NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD, ESPECIALLY UNDER FAILURE CONDITIONS.  THIS COMPLEXITY IS COMPOUNDED BY CURRENT TRENDS IN THE AVIATION INDUSTRY WHERE SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT AND INTEGRATION BUSINESS MODELS USE MULTITIER NETWORKS OF SUPPLIERS, BOTH DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN.  CURRENT REGULATION, POLICY AND GUIDANCE ALLOW FOR SUCH ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURES WITH A LARGE NUMBER OF PARTICIPATING COMPANIES.  HOWEVER, BECAUSE THE DISTRIBUTION OF RESPONSIBILITIES AMONG MANY DISPARATE ENTITIES WITH DIFFERENT AREAS AND LEVELS OF EXPERTISE CONTINUES TO INCREASE, THERE IS A GROWING POTENTIAL THAT THE SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS MAY NOT BE COMPLETE OR CORRECT AT EVERY LEVEL OF THE DESIGN.  MOREOVER, THE VALIDATION AND VERIFICATION PROCESSES MAY NOT ADEQUATELY COVER ALL POSSIBLE SOURCES AND MANNERS OF DESIGN ERRORS UNDER SUCH COMPLEX DEVELOPMENT STRUCTURES, THUS ALLOWING ERRORS OR OMISSIONS TO REMAIN EVEN AFTER FINAL CERTIFICATION APPROVAL.  CERTIFICATION AUTHORITIES ACTIVELY SUPPORT THE EFFORTS BY THE AVIATION INDUSTRY BY PROVIDING FLEXIBLE WAYS OF ACHIEVING COMPLIANCE AS MORE ADVANCED SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGIES ARE DEVELOPED.  NEVERTHELESS, ENSURING THAT THE SYSTEMS ARE SAFE AND COMPLY WITH THE AIRWORTHINESS REGULATIONS REMAINS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE MANUFACTURERS AND DEVELOPERS.  NEW METHODS, TOOLS, PROCESSES, GUIDELINES OR REGIMENS OF OVERSIGHT MAY BE NEEDED TO PRESERVE OR IMPROVE THE LEVEL OF SAFETY IN AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS AS TECHNOLOGY AND DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES CONTINUE TO EVOLVE.  THIS EFFORT SUPPORTS NASA'S AVIATION SAFETY PROGRAM S  SYSTEM-WIDE SAFETY ASSURANCE TECHNOLOGIES (SSAT) PROJECT  WHICH IS CONDUCTING RESEARCH DIRECTED AT IMPROVING THE SAFETY OF CURRENT AND FUTURE AIRCRAFT OPERATING IN THE NATIONAL AIRSPACE SYSTEM.  UNDER SSAT THERE IS A TECHNICAL CHALLENGE THAT TARGETS THE ASSURANCE OF FLIGHT CRITICAL SYSTEMS (AFCS)  A TECHNICAL CHALLENGE THAT ADDRESSES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE SOUND ASSURANCE OF SAFETY-CRITICAL DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS PROPERTIES AND THE COMPLEX INTERACTIONS BETWEEN SYSTEMS AND SUBSYSTEMS.  2.0  SCOPE&OBJECTIVE(S):  2.1 THE SCOPE OF THIS TASK ORDER IS FOR A STUDY ON THE SUBJECT OF COMPUTER-BASED AIRCRAFT SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT, SAFETY ASSURANCE, AND REGULATORY COMPLIANCE WITH MULTITIER SUPPLIER NETWORKS.   THIS STUDY IS TO IDENTIFY EFFECTIVE MEANS TO ENSURE, WITH A HIGH LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE, THAT COMPUTER-BASED AIRCRAFT-LEVEL SYSTEMS ARE SAFE AND COMPLIANT WITH THE LETTER AND INTENT OF REGULATIONS AND DEVELOPMENT GUIDANCE.    2.2 THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS TASK ORDER ARE TO GENERATE A DOCUMENT THAT:  DESCRIBES THE DEVELOPMENT OF MODERN COMPUTER-BASED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS OVER A MULTITIER NETWORK OF SUPPLIERS FOLLOWING RECOGNIZED DEVELOPMENT STANDA",3963,,,,

THE ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE AVIATION (ERA) PROJECT, A PROJECT OF ISRP, HAS THE GOAL TO EXPLORE AND ASSESS NEW VEHICLE CONCEPTS AND ENABLE TECHNOLOGIES THROUGH SYSTEM-LEVEL EXPERIMENTATION TO REDUCE FUEL BURN, NOISE AND EMISSIONS. SYSTEM STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT LAMINAR FLOW CONTROL (I.E., DELAY OF BOUNDARY LAYER TRANSITION) IS ONE OF THE KEY TECHNOLOGIES REQUIRED TO MEET THE ERA SYSTEM LEVEL METRICS BECAUSE OF THE SIGNIFICANT REALIZABLE REDUCTION OF SKIN FRICTION DRAG. THEREFORE, THE DRAG REDUCTION ELEMENT OF THE ERA PROJECT PRIMARILY FOCUSES ON MATURATION OF KEY TECHNOLOGIES TO DEMONSTRATE THE PRACTICAL FEASIBILITY OF LAMINAR FLOW CONTROL.  IN ORDER TO INVESTIGATE SWEPT-WING LAMINAR FLOW TECHNOLOGY, NASA INTENDS TO UTILIZE A TWO-PHASE PROCESS. PHASE I ENCOMPASSES THE EFFORT OF THIS TASK ORDER.  PHASE II (IF NASA DECIDES TO PROCEED), WILL BE FOR THE EXECUTION OF THE PROGRAM DEFINED DURING PHASE I.  2.0  SCOPE AND OBJECTIVE(S): 2.1 THE SCOPE OF THIS TASK ORDER (PHASE I) IS TO INVESTIGATE OPTIONS FOR EXECUTING A TEST PROGRAM THAT WOULD ENABLE THE ADVANCED AERODYNAMIC AND STRUCTURAL CONCEPTS RELEVANT TO COMMERCIAL TRANSPORT-CLASS VEHICLES (HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AS ERA VEHICLES) BY MATURING KEY AERODYNAMIC AND STRUCTURAL TECHNOLOGIES TO TECHNOLOGY READINESS LEVEL (TRL) AND MANUFACTURING READINESS LEVEL (MRL) 6. OF SPECIFIC INTEREST ARE OPTIONS FOR DEMONSTRATING SWEPT-WING LAMINAR FLOW (SWLF) TO MAXIMIZE ACHIEVABLE NATURAL LAMINAR FLOW REYNOLDS NUMBERS AT COMMERCIAL TRANSPORT RELEVANT CONDITIONS.   2.2 THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS TASK ORDER (PHASE I) IS TO DEFINE AN INTEGRATED ADVANCED WING TECHNOLOGY DEMONSTRATION (IAWTD) PROGRAM (TO BE EXECUTED IN PHASE II) THAT INCLUDES WING DESIGN CONCEPTS WITH LOADING AND SWEEP ANGLES APPROPRIATE FOR EFFICIENT 0.85 MACH NUMBER FLIGHT FOR RANGES AND PAYLOADS TYPICAL OF COMMERCIAL TRANSPORT VEHICLES, INCLUDING DEMONSTRATION OF SWEPT-WING LAMINAR FLOW WITH AND WITHOUT DISCRETE ROUGHNESS ELEMENTS (DRE).  3.0 DESCRIPTION OF THE WORK/TASKS TO BE PERFORMED:   THE CONTRACTOR SHALL PERFORM THE FOLLOWING TASKS:    3.1 VEHICLE AND WING CONCEPT IDENTIFICATION  3.1.1 THE CONTRACTOR SHALL CONDUCT A STUDY TO EXAMINE THE POTENTIAL ERA VEHICLES TO DETERMINE THE BEST OPTIONS FOR CANDIDATE WING SECTIONS TO PROVIDE REQUIREMENTS FOR CONDUCTING THE PHASE II FLIGHT TESTS TO ACHIEVE SOW 2.2 OBJECTIVE.  3.1.2 THE CONTRACTOR SHALL ESTIMATE, BASED ON ERA VEHICLES IN TASK 3.1.1, VARIOUS WING PROPERTIES INCLUDING AVERAGE WING LOADING, BENDING MOMENTS, AND TRANSITION REYNOLDS NUMBERS.  THESE PROPERTIES ARE TO BE COMPARED TO EXISTING STRUCTURAL AND SWLF CAPABILITIES TO CLEARLY INDICATE THE PROMISED ADVANCEMENTS WITH RESPECT TO THE CURRENT STATE OF THE ART.   3.1.3 THE CONTRACTOR SHALL DEFINE IAWTD PROGRAM ELEMENTS, INCLUDING GROUND AND FLIGHT TESTS, REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF SOW 2.2.  3.1.4 THE CONTRACTOR SHALL DEFINE A DRAFT SET OF TOP LEVEL REQUIREMENTS FOR THE IAWTD PROGRAM.
