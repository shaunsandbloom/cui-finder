NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION (NASA),"IGF::OT::IGF  SMAAART TASK ORDER SOW - REFINED AFC-ENABLED HIGH-LIFT SYSTEM INTEGRATION STUDY  1.0	INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND:  THE NASA FIXED WING (FW) PROJECT IS SEEKING TO DEMONSTRATE THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF REDUCING COMPLEXITIES ASSOCIATED WITH A MODERN HIGH-LIFT SYSTEM FOR LOW-SPEED FLIGHT CONDITIONS REPRESENTATIVE OF TAKEOFF AND LANDING WITHOUT SACRIFICING AERODYNAMIC OR ACOUSTIC PERFORMANCE.  ONE PROMISING APPROACH IS TO USE ACTIVE FLOW CONTROL (AFC) TO PROVIDE THE REQUIRED HIGH-LIFT PERFORMANCE WHILE REDUCING THE SYSTEM PART COUNT AND ASSOCIATED EXTERNAL DRAG.  NASA IS SEEKING TO EXPLORE AND EVALUATE AFC-ENABLED HIGH-LIFT SYSTEMS WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE FW PROJECT GOALS REGARDING NOISE AND FUEL BURN REDUCTIONS OF A MODERN CIVIL TRANSPORT AIRCRAFT.  MODERN HIGH-LIFT SYSTEMS ARE DESIGNED TO ALLOW A TRANSPORT AIRCRAFT WITH TYPICAL TRANSONIC CRUISE SPEEDS TO SAFELY OPERATE AT SLOW SPEEDS FOR LANDING AND TAKEOFF OPERATIONS.  THE HIGH-LIFT SYSTEM IS USUALLY SLOTTED BOTH ON THE LEADING EDGE AND THE TRAILING EDGE OF THE WING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE AERODYNAMIC PROPERTIES OF SLOTTED FLOWS AND ACHIEVE THE NECESSARY HIGH LIFT PERFORMANCE.  THE SLOTTED LEADING AND TRAILING EDGE DEVICES, AND THE ASSOCIATED SUB-SYSTEMS NECESSARY TO CHANGE THE WING CONFIGURATION FROM CRUISE TO LOW-SPEED, ARE COMPLEX AND EMPLOY A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF PARTS TO ENABLE SAFE OPERATION.  IN ADDITION, THESE COMPLEX MECHANICAL HIGH-LIFT SYSTEMS OFTEN PROTRUDE EXTERNALLY UNDER THE WINGS AND REQUIRE EXTERNAL FAIRINGS THAT RESULT IN INCREASED CRUISE DRAG.  THIS TASK ORDER BUILDS UPON WORK COMPLETED UNDER CONTRACT/TASK ORDER  NNL10AA05B/ NNL13AB65T) ENTITLED AFC-ENABLED HIGH-LIFT SYSTEM INTEGRATION STUDY, WHERE A SYSTEMS BENEFIT STUDY WAS PERFORMED ON THREE CANDIDATE AFC-ENABLED SIMPLIFIED HIGH-LIFT SYSTEMS FOR MODERN CIVIL TRANSPORTS.    FOR THIS TASK ORDER, A REFINED CONVENTIONAL HIGH-LIFT SYSTEM BASED ON THE NASA COMMON RESEARCH MODEL (CRM) WILL BE USED AS THE BASELINE FOR COMPARISON PURPOSE.  THIS UPDATED BASELINE WILL HAVE IMPROVED STALL CHARACTERISTICS FOR LANDING, ACCEPTABLE LIFT/DRAG (L/D) PERFORMANCE FOR TAKEOFF, AND INTEGRATED NACELLE/PYLON IN ADDITION TO THE WING-ONLY OPTION DEVELOPED UNDER SMAAART TASK ORDER # NNL13AB65T.  2.0 	SCOPE&OBJECTIVE(S):  2.1	THE SCOPE OF THIS TASK ORDER IS TO EXPLORE NEW DESIGN SPACE IN ORDER TO CLOSE THE TECHNOLOGY GAP IDENTIFIED FOR THE MASS FLOW REQUIREMENT AS APPLIED TO A REFINED AFC-ENABLED HIGH-LIFT SYSTEM.    2.2	THE OBJECTIVE(S) OF THIS TASK ORDER ARE TO:&#61607;	USE REFINED COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS (CFD)-BASED ANALYSIS TO CLOSE THE CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY GAP IDENTIFIED FOR THE MASS FLOW AND PRESSURE REQUIREMENTS.&#61607;	PERFORM SYSTEM-LEVEL TRADE STUDY TO DETERMINE WHETHER AFC YIELDS A CLOSED DESIGN.&#61607;	IDENTIFY TECHNICAL CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE INTEGRATION OF AN AFC SYSTEM.  3.0	DESCRIPTION OF THE WORK/TASKS TO BE PERFORMED:        THE CONTRACTOR SHALL PERFORM THE FOLLOWING TASKS:     3.1		REFINE CONVENTIONAL BASELINE HIGH-LIFT CONFIGURATION        3.1.1	USING THE NASA CRM GEOMETRY AS A STARTING POINT, THE CONTRACTOR SHALL DELIVER A DRAFT REFINED BASELINE CONVENTIONAL HIGH-LIFT DESIGN FOR TECHNICAL POINT OF CONTACT (TECH POC) FOR APPROVAL.  (DELIVERABLE ITEM 4.3).  THE TECH POC WILL PROVIDE WRITTEN APPROVAL VIA EMAIL TO THE CONTRACTOR WITH A COPY TO THE CONTRACTING OFFICER WITHIN 7 CALENDAR DAYS OF RECEIPT.  THIS REFINED BASELINE CONVENTIONAL HIGH-LIFT CONFIGURATION SHALL BE REPRESENTATIVE OF A MODERN IN-SERVICE COMMERCIAL TRANSPORT AIRCRAFT.  THIS INCLUDES HIGH LIFT STALL CHARACTERISTICS REPRESENTATIVE OF CURRENT PRODUCTION TRANSONIC TRANSPORT AIRCRAFT, AND A NACELLE/PYLON/WING INTEGRATION THAT AVOIDS HAVING SEPARATED FLOW OVER THE NACELLE ADVERSELY IMPACTING THE CRM HIGH-LIFT PERFORMANCE.    3.1.2	THE CONTRACTOR SHALL DELIVER THE FINAL REFINED BASELINE GEOMETRY FOR THE CONVENTIONAL HIGH LIFT SYSTEM AS INITIAL GRAPHICS EXCHANGE SPECIFICATION (IGES) FIL"

NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION (NASA),"IGF::OT::IGF  SMAAART TASK ORDER SOW - SLIT-TAPE BUCKLING  AFP PROCESS CHARACTERIZATION. 1.0	INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND: AS PART OF THE ADVANCED COMPOSITES PROJECT (ACP), NASA IS PARTNERING WITH THE AEROSPACE INDUSTRY TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE TIMELINE TO CERTIFY COMPOSITE STRUCTURE FOR COMMERCIAL AND MILITARY AERONAUTIC VEHICLES.  THREE MAIN FOCUS AREAS, OR TECHNICAL CHALLENGES, HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED BY NASA AND INDUSTRY AS HAVING MAJOR IMPACT ON THE CURRENT CERTIFICATION TIMELINE.  THE ACP THIRD TECHNICAL CHALLENGE (TC3), MANUFACTURING PROCESS AND SIMULATION, IS CONCERNED WITH REDUCING THE OCCURRENCE OF DEFECTS WHICH COMMONLY OCCUR IN AEROSPACE COMPOSITE STRUCTURES AS A RESULT OF THE PROCESSING METHODS UTILIZED TO FABRICATE THESE LARGE, HIGHLY COMPLEX VEHICLES.  ONE OF THE OBJECTIVES IN TC3 IS TO DEVELOP PHYSICS-BASED PROCESS MODELS WHICH ARE CAPABLE OF ACCURATELY PREDICTING THE FORMATION OF DEFECTS DURING ROBOTIC, AUTOMATED FIBER PLACEMENT (AFP) OF COMPOSITE STRUCTURE.  WHILE THE EFFICIENCY DEMONSTRATED IN AFP HAS LED TO ITS ADOPTION BY THE AEROSPACE INDUSTRY FOR FABRICATION OF AIRCRAFT FUSELAGE, WING, AND ENGINE NACELLE PRIMARY COMPOSITE STRUCTURES, THE POTENTIAL ADVANTAGES HAVE NOT BEEN FULLY REALIZED DUE TO THE OCCURRENCE OF PERFORMANCE REDUCING DEFECTS WHICH RESULT IN COSTLY AND TIME-CONSUMING REWORK.   THE DEVELOPMENT OF ACCURATE AFP PROCESS MODELS WILL GIVE AIRCRAFT MANUFACTURERS THE ABILITY TO PREDICT DEFECTS WHICH OCCUR DUE TO THE PHYSICAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE MATERIAL, THE PART TOOLING, AND THE AFP PROCESSING PARAMETERS.  THIS SCIENCE-BASED APPROACH TO MAXIMIZING PART QUALITY HAS PROVEN SUCCESSFUL IN OTHER COMPOSITE PROCESSING METHODOLOGIES SUCH AS INFUSION FLOW PREDICTION AND CURE PROCESS DEFECTS SUCH AS RESIDUAL STRESS.  HOWEVER, CURRENTLY NO VALIDATED PHYSICS-BASED PROCESS MODEL EXISTS TO PREDICT DEFECTS SUCH AS FIBER / TAPE BUCKLING, ALSO REFERRED TO AS FIBER WAVINESS, WRINKLING, PUCKERING, OR WINDOW-SHADING.  AN AFP PROCESS MODEL WHICH ACCURATELY PREDICTS PROCESS DEFECTS WILL SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE TRIAL AND ERROR FABRICATION EFFORT REQUIRED TO MEET PRODUCTION CERTIFICATION OF AEROSPACE COMPOSITE STRUCTURE.    THE WORK DESCRIBED IN THIS SOW IS INTENDED TO ADDRESS FABRICATION ISSUES THAT HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE TIMELINE REQUIRED TO CERTIFY COMPOSITE STRUCTURES. THE INTENTION OF THIS TASK ORDER IS TO CHARACTERIZE THE AFP PROCESS PARAMETERS DURING THE FABRICATION OF PARTS WHICH IN THE PAST HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO CONTAIN DEFECTS SUCH AS WRINKLING OR PUCKERING. THE GOVERNMENT WILL UTILIZE A WELL CHARACTERIZED AEROSPACE TOUGHENED EPOXY MATERIAL, HEXCEL IM7 / 8552-1 PREPREG, SO THAT THE CHARACTERIZATION STUDY IS FOCUSED ON THE AFP PLACEMENT PARAMETERS WHICH AFFECT THE FORMATION OF THE WRINKLING / PUCKERING DEFECTS. THESE PROCESSING PARAMETERS, FOR EXAMPLE, INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO: PLACEMENT SPEED, COMPACTION LOAD, MATERIAL TEMPERATURE, AND/OR HEAD TURNING RADIUS. THE GEOMETRY USED TO EVALUATE THE VARIOUS AFP PROCESSING PARAMETERS WILL BE LIMITED TO THE TYPE AND FORM WHICH HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED IN PREVIOUS BUILDS BY THE FABRICATOR TO RESULT IN FORMATION OF THE WRINKLING / PUCKERING DEFECTS. THE RESULTS OF THIS AFP PROCESSING CHARACTERIZATION EFFORT WILL BE UTILIZED IN THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF AN AFP PHYSICS-BASED PROCESS MODEL TO PREDICT THESE TYPES OF DEFECTS.  2.0	SCOPE&OBJECTIVE(S):  2.1	THE SCOPE OF THIS TASK ORDER IS TO FABRICATE COMPOSITE PANELS USING THE AFP PROCESS AND CHARACTERIZE THE AFP PROCESS BY MEASURING THE PROCESSING PARAMETERS WHICH RESULT IN FIBER / TAPE BUCKLING DEFECTS (WRINKLING / PUCKERING).        2.2	THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS TASK ORDER ARE TO:  A.	DETERMINE AFP PLACEMENT PARAMETERS AND PLACEMENT PARAMETER INTERACTIONS WHICH INFLUENCE THE FORMATION AND MAGNITUDE OF WRINKLING / PUCKERING DEFECTS FOR THE FIXED PART GEOMETRY FABRICATED USING 0.25 WIDE HEXCEL IM7 / 8552-1 SLIT-TAPE PREPREG. B.	EMPIRICALLY CHARACTERIZE THE AFP PROCESSING PARAMETERS AND QUANTIFY"

THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR (PI)-LED MISSION WILL LAUNCH ON A COMMERCIAL COMMUNICATIONS SATELLITE TO MAKE OBSERVATIONS OVER THE AMERICAS FROM AN ORBIT OF APPROXIMATELY 22,000 MILES (35,400 KILOMETERS) ABOVE THE EQUATOR. THE MISSION WAS COMPETITIVELY SELECTED FROM 15 PROPOSALS SUBMITTED TO THE AGENCY'S SECOND EARTH VENTURE - MISSION ANNOUNCEMENT OF OPPORTUNITY FOR SMALL ORBITAL INVESTIGATIONS OF THE EARTH SYSTEM.  THE PRIMARY GOALS OF THE GEOCARB MISSION ARE TO MONITOR PLANT HEALTH AND VEGETATION STRESS THROUGHOUT THE AMERICAS, TO PROBE, IN UNPRECEDENTED DETAIL, THE NATURAL SOURCES, SINKS AND EXCHANGE PROCESSES THAT CONTROL CARBON DIOXIDE, CARBON MONOXIDE AND METHANE IN THE ATMOSPHERE, AND TO PROVIDE OBSERVATIONS AND DEMONSTRATE METHODS TO REALIZE A TRANSFORMATIONAL ADVANCE IN THE SCIENTIFIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE GLOBAL CARBON CYCLE.  THE GEOCARB MISSION, A CATEGORY 3 MISSION (PER NPR 7120.5E, NASA SPACE FLIGHT PROGRAM AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS) WITH A CLASS D PAYLOAD (PER NPR 8705.4, RISK CLASSIFICATION FOR NASA PAYLOADS), IS A SCIENCE INVESTIGATION WITH THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVING KNOWLEDGE OF TERRESTRIAL FLUXES OF CO2 AND CH4 AT SCIENCE- AND POLICY-RELEVANT SCALES. THE GEOCARB MISSION UTILIZES A MULTI-CHANNEL SLIT-SCAN SPECTROMETER BASED INSTRUMENT THAT WILL MEASURE ABSORPTION SPECTRA IN SUNLIGHT REFLECTED FROM THE GROUND TO INFER THE ATMOSPHERE-COLUMN CONCENTRATIONS OF CO2, CH4, AND CARBON MONOXIDE (CO). THE INSTRUMENT WILL ALSO MEASURE SOLAR-INDUCED FLUORESCENCE (SIF), WHICH PROVIDES DIRECT INFORMATION ABOUT PHOTOSYNTHESIS.  THE CONTRACTOR AND ITS TEAM MEMBERS WILL PERFORM THE FULL NASA LIFE CYCLE FORMULATION AND IMPLEMENTATION PHASES A THROUGH F.

RESEARCH IS ORGANIZED INTO THREE PROJECT AREAS: (1) SYSTEM-WIDE SAFETY AND ASSURANCE TECHNOLOGIES (SSAT), (2) VEHICLE SYSTEMS SAFETY TECHNOLOGIES (VSST), AND (3) ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT SAFETY TECHNOLOGIES (AEST).  THIS SOW SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSES LONG-TERM TECHNICAL CHALLENGES IN BOTH THE SSAT AND VSST PROJECTS.  	SSAT, ASSURANCE OF FLIGHT CRITICAL SYSTEMS  DEVELOPMENT OF VERIFICATION AND VALIDATION (V&V) TECHNIQUES TO ESTABLISH CONFIDENCE THAT NEW TECHNOLOGIES ARE SAFE AND PROVIDE A COST-EFFECTIVE BASIS FOR ASSURANCE AND CERTIFICATION OF COMPLEX CIVIL AVIATION SYSTEMS.  	SSAT, ASSURING SAFE HUMAN-SYSTEMS INTEGRATION  ENABLE THE DEVELOPMENT OF ROBUST HUMAN-AUTOMATION SYSTEMS BY INCORPORATING KNOWN LIMITATIONS OF HUMAN PERFORMANCE INTO ANALYSIS TOOLS.    	VSST, IMPROVED CREW DECISION MAKING AND RESPONSE IN COMPLEX SITUATIONS  DEMONSTRATE CAPABILITIES THAT ENABLE PILOTS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND AND RESPOND SAFELY TO COMPLEX SITUATIONS.  	VSST, SAFE AND EFFECTIVE AIRCRAFT CONTROL UNDER HAZARDOUS CONDITIONS  DEVELOP INTEGRATED GUIDANCE, CONTROL, AND SYSTEM TECHNOLOGIES THAT ENABLE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE CREW/SYSTEM AIRCRAFT CONTROL UNDER HAZARDOUS CONDITIONS.  MORE SPECIFICALLY, WITHIN THE ASSURANCE OF FLIGHT CRITICAL SYSTEMS CHALLENGE OF SSAT, THERE IS A SUB-CHALLENGE RELATED TO THE VERIFICATION AND VALIDATION OF AUTHORITY AND AUTONOMY (A&A) CONSTRUCTS.  AUTHORITY, IN THE CONTEXT OF AIRCRAFT OPERATIONS, REFERS TO HAVING THE RIGHT, OR POWER, TO EXERCISE CONTROLS THAT WILL CHANGE THE POSITION, VELOCITY, AND/OR ATTITUDE OF AN AIRCRAFT.  AUTONOMY REFERS TO A FUNCTION OR SYSTEM THAT CAN OPERATE INDEPENDENTLY OF PILOT OR CONTROLLER INTERVENTION.  FOR CURRENT AIRCRAFT OPERATIONS, PILOTS AND AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS ARE THE AUTHORITIES; HOWEVER, THEY MAY, AND DO, DELEGATE AUTHORITY TO AUTOMATION FOR SELECTED ACTIVITIES OR FUNCTIONS (E.G., AUTO-LAND SYSTEMS).  IN THESE CASES, THE PILOT AND/OR AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MONITORING THE PERFORMANCE OF THE AUTOMATION TO ASSURE IT PERFORMS ITS INTENDED FUNCTION, AND TO RECLAIM AUTHORITY SHOULD IT FAIL, OR OTHERWISE DE-COUPLE PER ITS DESIGN LOGIC.  THIS PARADIGM HAS WORKED WELL AND HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO BE SAFE FOR MANY SITUATIONS  DUE LARGELY TO ESTABLISHED V&V PROCESSES FOR SYSTEMS AND PROCEDURES, AS WELL AS TRAINING.  HOWEVER, THERE REMAIN SITUATIONS THAT THESE PROCESSES CANNOT ACCOUNT FOR, OR PREDICT.  THE PURPOSE OF THE RESEARCH THAT THIS SOW CONTRIBUTES TO IS TO STUDY ONE CLASS OF SUCH SITUATIONS  THOSE INVOLVING LOSS OF AIRPLANE STATE  AWARENESS BY THE FLIGHT CREW AND AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS.  2.0 	SCOPE / OBJECTIVE:  THE SCOPE OF THIS EFFORT IS TO EXAMINE METHODS FOR ASSESSING WHETHER, AND HOW, OPERATIONAL CONSTRUCTS PROPERLY ASSIGN AUTHORITY AND AUTONOMY IN A SAFE AND COORDINATED MANNER WITH PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON ASSURING ADEQUATE AIRPLANE STATE AWARENESS BY THE FLIGHT CREW AND AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS IN OFF-NOMINAL AND/OR COMPLEX SITUATIONS.  ONE OUTCOME SHOULD BE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVING DESIGN STANDARDS AND V&V TECHNIQUES TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS TRANSPARENCY OF BOTH AUTHORITY TRANSITION MECHANICS (E.G., MODE TRANSITIONS AND DE-COUPLING), AND THEIR CONSEQUENCES.  THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS TASK IS TO DELIVER A FINAL REPORT THAT DOCUMENTS THE FOLLOWING:  (1) 	CURRENT PROCESSES USED BY THE INDUSTRY TO CONDUCT V&V ACTIVITIES TO ASSURE THAT AIRPLANE STATE AWARENESS IS MAINTAINED IN CASES WHERE AUTOMATED SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN DELEGATED THE AUTHORITY TO CHANGE AIRPLANE STATE;  (2) 	RESULTS OF AN ANALYSES OF T"

NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION (NASA),"THE PRIMARY MISSION FOR THE CUBESAT IS TO MEASURE THE TEMPERATURE OF A SMALL METALLIC OBJECT COATED WITH THE CRYOGENIC SELECTIVE SURFACE COATING IN SPACE. THESE ARE THE PRIMARY SCIENCE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE CUBESAT SYSTEM. THE CUBESAT SHALL PROVIDE ADEQUATE SHIELDING FROM EARTHS ALBEDO RADIATION AND FROM THE HEAT GENERATED BY THE CUBESAT ITSELF USING SUCH THAT THE COATED SAMPLE IS NOT ADVERSELY HEATED.  THE CUBESAT SHALL INCLUDE A METHOD OF ATTACHING THE SAMPLE TO THE CUBESAT SUCH THAT MINIMAL HEAT IS CONDUCTED TO THE SAMPLE UNDER TEST. THE CUBESAT SHALL MAINTAIN ORIENTATION OF THE COATED SAMPLE TOWARD DEEP SPACE.  TWO TEMPERATURE SENSORS PER EACH SAMPLE WHERE ONE SHALL BE USED TO MEASURE THE SAMPLE TEMPERATURE LOCATED IN THE SMALL METALLIC OBJECT UNDER THE COATING AND THE OTHER SHALL BE USED TO MEASURE THE TEMPERATURE OF THE WALL AND STRUCTURE CLOSEST TO THE SAMPLE.  HUNDREDS OF PAPERS HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED ON DESIGNING SURFACES THAT REFLECT ONE WAVELENGTH RANGE WHILE ABSORBING ANOTHER IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE SIGNIFICANT TEMPERATURE INCREASES OR DECREASES OF THESE SURFACES IN SUNLIGHT. THE MAJORITY OF THIS WORK WAS DEVOTED TO ACHIEVING HIGH TEMPERATURES TO SUPPORT, FOR EXAMPLE, SOLAR FURNACE OPERATION, BUT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION WAS DIRECTED TO COOLING. COATINGS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED TO ALLOW A SURFACE IN SUNLIGHT TO COOL BELOW AMBIENT, BUT ATMOSPHERIC LIMITATIONS, INFRARED TRANSMISSION WINDOWS AND CONVECTIVE WARMING, PREVENT SIGNIFICANT COOLING. HOWEVER, HIBBARD, OF THE LEWIS RESEARCH CENTER, REALIZED THAT IN SPACE, AWAY FROM THESE ATMOSPHERIC LIMITATIONS, THAT SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER COOLING COULD BE ACHIEVED. SINCE THEN, A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TESTING HAS BEEN COMPLETED ON MANY DIFFERENT COATING MATERIALS. THE RESULTS OF THIS TESTING SHOW THAT WHEN COMBINED WITH MULTI-LAYER INSULATION TO SHIELD FROM EARTH RADIATION, IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE TO PASSIVELY COOL A COMPONENT TO SIGNIFICANTLY LOW TEMPERATURES. THESE TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO PASSIVELY STORE CRYOGENS IN SPACE FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME.  CUBESATS RECENTLY HAVE BECOME POPULAR IN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY.  CUBESAT IS A TYPE OF SPACECRAFT THAT TYPICALLY USES COMMERCIAL, OFF-THE-SHELF ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS IN A SCALABLE CUBESAT FORM FACTOR WITH A MASS OF ONE KG AND A VOLUME OF TEN CUBIC CENTIMETERS. THESE SMALL FORM FACTOR SATELLITES PROVIDE A LOW COST OPTION TO PERFORM SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND DEMONSTRATE NEW SPACE TECHNOLOGIES IN ORBIT."

THE CAPABILITY ADDRESSED REPRESENTS AN ADVANCED SYSTEM TO FURTHER CLOSE THE ATMOSPHERE REVITALIZATION LOOP ON LONG DURATION HUMAN SPACECRAFT. NASA SPACE TECHNOLOGY ROADMAP TA 6  HUMAN HEALTH, LIFE SUPPORT AND HABITATION SYSTEMS  ESTABLISHED FOR THE TECHNOLOGY PERFORMANCE GOAL OF INCREASING THE PERCENTAGE OF OXYGEN RECOVERED FROM METABOLIC CARBON DIOXIDE TO 75-90%. AS FUTURE EXPLORATION MISSIONS EXTEND BEYOND LOW EARTH ORBIT (LEO), VEHICLES WILL REQUIRE LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEMS (LSS) WITH HIGH RELIABILITY AND SELF-SUFFICIENCY, AS PRACTICAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR CONSUMABLE RESUPPLY WILL NOT EXIST. AN EFFECTIVE LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEM MUST MAINTAIN A SAFE AND HABITABLE ATMOSPHERE WITHIN A SPACECRAFT BY REMOVING CONTAMINANTS WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY MAINTAINING THE PROPER ATMOSPHERIC COMPOSITION AND CABIN PRESSURE. THE GOAL OF THIS EFFORT IS TO ADVANCE THE STATE-OF-THE-ART OF ATMOSPHERIC REVITALIZATION SYSTEM TECHNOLOGIES REQUIRED TO ENABLE NASA S HUMAN EXPLORATION MISSIONS.

NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION (NASA),"IGF::OT::IGF     TASK ORDER - STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW)  TASK TITLE: FLIGHT SERVICES AND AIRCRAFT ACCESS INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND: THE PURPOSE OF THE OVERALL ACTIVITY UNDERTAKEN BY THE NASA ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE AVIATION (ERA) PROJECT AND THE CONTRACTOR IS TO DETERMINE THE APPLICABILITY OF ACTIVE SEPARATION CONTROL TO COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT OPERATION, CONSIDERING THAT AERODYNAMIC PERFORMANCE, SYSTEM INTEGRATION COMPLEXITY, AND SYSTEM COSTS IN TERMS OF REQUIRED ENERGY ARE PART OF THE DECISION PROCESS.   VERTICAL TAIL SIZING ON COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT IS DRIVEN, IN LARGE PART, BY PERFORMANCE REQUIRED FOR EMERGENCY SITUATIONS AND/OR OPERATIONS NEAR THE EDGES OF THE FLIGHT ENVELOPE.  FOR AIRCRAFT WHERE THE ENGINES ARE MOUNTED ON THE WINGS, ENGINE-OUT CONDITIONS RELY HEAVILY ON THE RUDDER TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT YAWING MOMENT TO TRIM OUT THE AIRPLANE.  AS PART OF THE ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE AVIATION (ERA) PROJECT, NASA IS SEEKING TO DEMONSTRATE THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF REDUCING VERTICAL TAIL SIZE THROUGH THE USE OF ACTIVE FLOW CONTROL (AFC). THE AFC-ENABLED VERTICAL TAIL WOULD UTILIZE AFC TO PROVIDE REQUIRED PERFORMANCE AT FLIGHT CONDITIONS THAT DRIVE THE SIZING OF THE VERTICAL TAIL WHILE OPERATING IN A CONVENTIONAL MANNER AT ALL OTHER FLIGHT CONDITIONS. AS PART OF THE ERA PROJECT, NASA ALSO IS SEEKING TO DEMONSTRATE THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF INSECT ACCRETION AND MITIGATION (IAM) (INSECT PROTECTION).  IAM COATING TECHNOLOGIES ARE USED TO MITIGATE WING AND LEADING EDGE INSECT RESIDUE ADHESION IN ORDER TO ENHANCE AND MAINTAIN WING LAMINAR FLOW. ONE OF THE CHALLENGES FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF WING LAMINAR FLOW IS PREMATURE LOSS OF LAMINAR FLOW FROM ROUGHNESS INDUCED BY INSECT CONTAMINATION.   NASA WILL FLIGHT TEST BOTH THE AFC MASS FLOW DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM (AFC SYSTEM) AND IAM COATING TECHNOLOGIES ON A COMMERCIAL AIRLINER VERTICAL TAIL AND WING RESPECTIVELY, WITH THE CONTRACTOR PROVIDING FLIGHT SERVICES AND AIRCRAFT ACCESS.  THE FLIGHT TESTS ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR NO EARLIER THAN AUGUST 2014. 2	SCOPE, OBJECTIVES, APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS, AND DEFINITIONS FOR TERMS AND ACRONYMS: 2.1	SCOPE: THE SCOPE OF THIS TASK ORDER IS TO FABRICATE, INSTALL, AND FLIGHT TEST AFC AND IAM TECHNOLOGIES ON LARGE, COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT TEST BED (THE BOEING 757 ECODEMONSTRATOR).   2.2	OBJECTIVES FOR THIS TASK ORDER ARE AS FOLLOWS: 	FABRICATE AN AFC SYSTEM IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE AFC SYSTEM DESIGN DEVELOPED UNDER SMAAART TASK ORDER NNL13AC06T 	MODIFY THE 757 BLEED AIR SYSTEM IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE AFC SYSTEM DESIGN DEVELOPED UNDER SMAAART TASK ORDER NNL13AC06T 	INSTALL THE AFC SYSTEM INTO THE BOEING 757 ECODEMONSTRATOR VERTICAL TAIL IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE AFC SYSTEM DESIGN DEVELOPED UNDER SMAAART TASK ORDER NNL13AC06T 	FLIGHT TEST THE AFC SYSTEM INCLUDING BASELINE AND UP TO 2 AFC CONFIGURATIONS.

NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION (NASA),"IGF::OT::IGF INNOVATIVE AIRCRAFT PROPULSION SYSTEM DEFINITION AND INTEGRATION STUDY - SMAAART (STRUCTURES MATERIALS, AERODYNAMICS, AEROTHERMODYNAMICS, AND ACOUSTICS RESEARCH&TECHNOLOGY) TASK ORDER STATEMENT OF WORK- 1.0 INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND: ELECTRICALLY-POWERED AIRCRAFT WILL REVOLUTIONIZE THE WAY WE TRAVEL, BRINGING DRAMATIC INCREASES IN EFFICIENCY AND RELIABILITY, REDUCED EMISSIONS, AND REDUCED NOISE AS COMPARED TO TODAY S COMBUSTION-POWERED AIRCRAFT. THIS STUDY EFFORT WILL SUPPORT THE DESIGN OF A NOVEL FLIGHT DEMONSTRATION CONCEPT THAT WILL ENABLE THE BENEFITS OF ELECTRIC PROPULSION WHILE KEEPING THE CONVENIENCE AND UTILITY OF COMMON FUELS AVAILABLE AT TODAY S AIRPORTS. THE LARGEST DRAWBACK OF ELECTRICALLY-POWERED AIRCRAFT HAS BEEN THE ONBOARD ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEM NAMELY, ITS WEIGHT, COST, AND LOGISTICAL NEEDS. A PROMISING ENERGY STORAGE MECHANISM FOR ELECTRIC AIRCRAFT IS THE FUEL CELL. WITH ONGOING DEVELOPMENT, FUEL CELLS HAVE A GREAT POTENTIAL TO REPLACE INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINES (ICE) AS THEY OFFER HIGHER EFFICIENCIES AND LOWER EMISSIONS. OVERALL, THE USE OF A SOLID OXIDE FUEL CELL (SOFC)-ENABLED ELECTRIC PROPULSION ARCHITECTURE HAS THE MOST PROMISE TO ENABLE TRANSITION TO ELECTRIC PROPULSION. THE SOFC ENABLED ELECTRIC PROPULSION SYSTEM CAN REFORM TRADITIONAL FUELS INTO ELECTRICITY AT HIGH EFFICIENCY, THUS ADDING NO INFRASTRUCTURE COST OR UTILITY PENALTY THE AIRCRAFT CAN USE THE EXACT SAME AIRPORTS AND FUEL DEPOTS AS BEFORE. THE HIGH EFFICIENCY OF THE SOFC VS. THE ICE RESULTS IN LESS FUEL USAGE (AND THEREFORE LOWER OPERATING COSTS), AND IS DIRECTLY CORRELATED WITH LOWER CARBON EMISSIONS. IN ADDITION, THE REDUCTION IN TEMPERATURE OF THE SOFC REFORMER VS. ICE COMBUSTION LEADS TO ELIMINATION OF NITROGEN OXIDES FROM THE EXHAUST. THIS STUDY EFFORT COMPRISES A SOFC SYSTEM DESIGN AND INSTALLATION TO ENABLE AN INNOVATIVE ELECTRIC AIRCRAFT. THIS TASK ORDER IS A RESULT OF A COMPETITIVE SELECTION OF A 2015 AERONAUTICS RESEARCH MISSION DIRECTORATE (ARMD) SEEDLING PHASE I PROPOSAL THROUGH THE NASA AERONAUTICS RESEARCH INSTITUTE (NARI). 2.0 SCOPE&OBJECTIVE(S): 2.1 THE SCOPE OF THIS TASK ORDER IS TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF MERGING A SOFC-ENABLED ELECTRIC PROPULSION ARCHITECTURE WITH AN EXISTING LIGHT AIRCRAFT DESIGN BY DEFINING A CANDIDATE POWER ARCHITECTURE WHILE QUANTIFYING PERFORMANCE, COST, AND RISK. THIS TASK ORDER WILL GENERATE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN DATA AND TEST PLANS FOR A SELECTED SOFC ARCHITECTURE AND SUPPORT THE VETTING OF THE SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS AND DESIGN THROUGH TWO COMPLETE DESIGN CYCLE ITERATIONS. 2.2 THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS TASK ORDER ARE TO: DEFINE THE DESIGN SPACE AND DEVELOP REQUIREMENTS FOR THE SOFC SYSTEM. PERFORM TRADE STUDIES AND IDENTIFY THE PREFERRED SOFC ARCHITECTURE CONCEPT. PERFORM ENGINEERING AND ANALYSIS TO DEVELOP A TECHNICAL DEFINITION OF THE PREFERRED SOFC SYSTEM SUPPORTING CONFIGURATION AND LAYOUT OF THE OVERALL AIR VEHICLE SYSTEM. CONDUCT PERFORMANCE, RISK, AND COST ANALYSES OF THE PREFERRED SOFC ARCHITECTURE CREATE A DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP AND DEFINE THE FOLLOW-ON SOFC SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT PHASE. 3.0 DESCRIPTION OF THE WORK/TASKS TO BE PERFORMED: THE CONTRACTOR SHALL PERFORM THE FOLLOWING TASKS: 3.1 SOFC SYSTEM SCALING STUDIES AND REQUIREMENTS DEVELOPMENT 3.1.1 THE CONTRACTOR SHALL CONDUCT SOFC SCALING STUDIES AND DEVELOP TOP-LEVEL SOFC DESIGN REQUIREMENTS BASED ON AN INITIAL SET OF SCALING STUDY PARAMETERS PROVIDED BY THE GOVERNMENT (GFI ITEM 5.1).

IN THE PROPOSED FIM CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS, AN AIRCRAFT THAT IS EQUIPPED WITH ADS-B MAY BE CLEARED BY A CONTROLLER TO ACHIEVE AND/OR MAINTAIN AN INTERVAL RELATIVE TO ANOTHER AIRCRAFT.  PILOTS ARE PROVIDED WITH A SPEED TARGET AND A LOCATION AT WHICH TO ACHIEVE THIS SPEED (THE ACHIEVE-BY POINT), AND A TRAFFIC-TO-FOLLOW (TTF) AIRCRAFT IDENTIFIER IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THIS INTERVAL.  FIM OPERATIONS ARE PURPORTED TO INCREASE THROUGHPUT, REDUCE TACTICAL MANEUVERING (ESPECIALLY VECTORING), REDUCE CONTROLLER WORKLOAD, AND REDUCE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT BY ENABLING OPTIMIZED PROFILE DESCENTS (AKA CONTINUOUS DESCENT ARRIVALS).  FUTURE CONCEPTS OF OPERATIONS ENVISION REDUCED INTERACTION WITH CONTROLLERS AND INCREASED AUTOMATION.  THE QUESTION AT HAND IS HOW TECHNOLOGY, PROCEDURES, AND PILOT TRAINING SHOULD BE DESIGNED TO EFFECTIVELY SUPPORT FIM OPERATIONS.    IN RECENT YEARS, FIM RESEARCH HAS BEEN CONDUCTED AT NASA LANGLEY UNDER THE AIRSPACE SYSTEMS PROGRAM AND AT A SMALL NUMBER OF OTHER LABORATORIES AND INSTITUTIONS.  UNDER THE PRIOR NASA FLIGHT CRITICAL SYSTEMS RESEARCH (FCSR) CONTRACT / TASK ORDER (I.E., NNL06AA05B, TASK ORDER NNL13AB30T), NASA AND THE FAA SPONSORED THE DEVELOPMENT OF A CITATION DATABASE AND ASSOCIATED MULTIMEDIA RELATIONAL DATABASE OF FIM LITERATURE AND FLIGHT DECK INTERFACE DESIGN CONCEPTS.  THE OBJECTIVE OF THAT PRIOR AWARD WAS TO PROVIDE TOOLS TO THE RESEARCH COMMUNITY SUCH THAT FUTURE RESEARCH COULD BENEFIT FROM A COMMON AND ACCESSIBLE REPOSITORY OF PRIOR EFFORTS, TO FACILITATE COMPARISON AND SUMMARIZATION OF RESEARCH RESULTS, AND TO ENCOURAGE THE FUTURE INCORPORATION OF RESEARCH RESULTS AND DESIGN CONCEPTS IN THIS REPOSITORY.   AS PART OF THE PREVIOUS TASK ORDER NNL13AB30T, NASA AND THE FAA IDENTIFIED ADDITIONAL FUNCTIONALITY THAT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL TO THE RESEARCH COMMUNITY.  THIS NEW EFFORT WILL AUGMENT THE PRIOR DEVELOPMENT OF THE LITERATURE DATABASE AND THE FIM CONCEPTS DATABASE.   2.0  SCOPE&OBJECTIVE(S):  2.1 THE SCOPE OF THIS EFFORT IS TO AUGMENT THE LITERATURE DATABASE AND THE FIM CONCEPTS DATABASE PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED UNDER TASK ORDER NNL13AB30T, AS DEFINED BY THE SPECIFIC TASKS BELOW.    2.2 THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS TASK ORDER IS TO DELIVER UPDATED DATABASES AND ASSOCIATED USER INTERFACE MECHANISMS, EXTEND THE CONCEPTS AND TOOLS, PROVIDE PRESENTATION MATERIAL, AND DEVELOP A SOFTWARE MIGRATION PLAN FOR THE AFOREMENTIONED FIM LITERATURE AND CONCEPTS DATABASE.  3.0 DESCRIPTION OF THE WORK/TASKS TO BE PERFORMED:    THE CONTRACTOR SHALL PERFORM THE FOLLOWING TASKS:     3.1 UPDATE DATABASE CONTENT&ENSURE VERSION INFORMATION AVAILABLE   3.1.1  AT A MINIMUM, THE CONTRACTOR SHALL CONDUCT ONLINE DATABASE SEARCHES AND CONTACT RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS/PERSONS (WITH CC TO TECH POC) CURRENTLY INCLUDED IN THE DATABASES TO OBTAIN PUBLICATIONS AND RESEARCH NOTES COMPLETED SINCE THE PRIOR LITERATURE REVIEW CONDUCTED UNDER TASK ORDER NNL13AB30T. CONTACTS ACCESSED AND RESULTS OF THIS REVIEW {E.G., CITATIONS, PAPERS (UNLESS LIMITED BY COPYRIGHT), PRESENTATIONS} SHALL BE DELIVERED (DELIVERABLE 4.2).      3.1.2  THE CONTRACTOR SHALL INCORPORATE NEW REFERENCE DOCUMENTS IN THE LITERATURE DATABASE AND NEW FIM CONCEPTS IN THE CONCEPT DATABASE TO UPDATE THE CONTENTS.  IF MORE THAN 20 REFERENCE DOCUMENTS AND DESIGNS ARE IDENTIFIED, AND IF MORE THAN 3 ADDITIONAL CONCEPTS ARE IDENTIFIED, THE NASA TECHNICAL POINT OF CONTACT (TECH POC) WILL COMMUNICATE VIA EMAIL TO THE CONTRACTOR PI THE SELECTED ITEMS TO INCLUDE.     3.1.3  THE CONTRACTOR SHALL ENSURE THAT USERS CAN"

NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION (NASA),"""IGF::OT::IGF"" OTHER FUNCTIONS - TROPOSPHERIC EMISSIONS: MONITORING OF POLLUTION (TEMPO) - THE TEMPO INVESTIGATION WAS SELECTED UNDER THE NASA SECOND STAND ALONE MISSIONS OF OPPORTUNITY NOTICE (SALMON-2) ANNOUNCEMENT OF OPPORTUNITY (AO) PROGRAM ELEMENT APPENDIX J, NNH12ZDA006O-EVI1 FOR THE EARTH VENTURE INSTRUMENT-1 (EVI-1) ELEMENT OF THE EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE PATHFINDER (ESSP) PROGRAM OFFICE'S EARTH VENTURE LINE.  TEMPO MEASURES POLLUTION OF NORTH AMERICA, FROM MEXICO CITY TO THE CANADIAN TAR/OIL SANDS, AND FROM THE ATLANTIC TO THE PACIFIC, HOURLY AND AT HIGH SPATIAL RESOLUTION. TEMPO SPECTROSCOPIC MEASUREMENTS IN THE ULTRAVIOLET AND VISIBLE AND PROVIDES A TROPOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT SUITE THAT INCLUDES THE KEY ELEMENTS OF TROPOSPHERIC AIR POLLUTION CHEMISTRY. MEASUREMENTS ARE FROM GEOSTATIONARY ORBIT, TO CAPTURE THE INHERENT HIGH VARIABILITY IN THE DIURNAL CYCLE OF EMISSIONS AND CHEMISTRY. A SMALL PRODUCT SPATIAL FOOTPRINT RESOLVES POLLUTION SOURCES AT SUB-URBAN SCALE. TOGETHER, THIS TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL RESOLUTION IMPROVES EMISSION INVENTORIES, MONITORS POPULATION EXPOSURE, AND ENABLES EFFECTIVE EMISSION-CONTROL STRATEGIES.  TEMPO TAKES ADVANTAGE OF A GEOSTATIONARY (GEO) HOST SPACECRAFT TO PROVIDE A MODEST COST MISSION THAT MEASURES THE SPECTRA REQUIRED TO RETRIEVE O3, NO2, SO2, H2CO, C2H2O2, H2O, AEROSOLS, CLOUD PARAMETERS, AND UVB RADIATION. TEMPO THUS MEASURES THE MAJOR ELEMENTS, DIRECTLY OR BY PROXY, IN THE TROPOSPHERIC O3 CHEMISTRY CYCLE. MULTI-SPECTRAL OBSERVATIONS PROVIDE SENSITIVITY TO O3 IN THE LOWERMOST TROPOSPHERE, REDUCING UNCERTAINTY IN AIR QUALITY PREDICTIONS BY 50%. TEMPO QUANTIFIES AND TRACKS THE EVOLUTION OF AEROSOL LOADING. IT PROVIDES NEAR-REAL-TIME AIR QUALITY PRODUCTS THAT WILL BE MADE WIDELY, PUBLICLY AVAILABLE.  TEMPO MAKES THE FIRST TROPOSPHERIC TRACE GAS MEASUREMENTS FROM GEO, BY BUILDING ON THE HERITAGE OF FIVE SPECTROMETERS FLOWN IN LOW-EARTH-ORBIT (LEO). THESE LEO INSTRUMENTS MEASURE THE NEEDED SPECTRA, ALTHOUGH AT COARSE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL RESOLUTIONS, TO THE PRECISIONS REQUIRED FOR TEMPO AND USE RETRIEVAL ALGORITHMS DEVELOPED FOR THEM BY TEMPO SCIENCE TEAM MEMBERS AND CURRENTLY RUNNING IN OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENTS. THIS MAKES TEMPO AN INNOVATIVE USE OF A WELL PROVEN TECHNIQUE, ABLE TO PRODUCE A REVOLUTIONARY DATASET.  TEMPO PROVIDES MUCH OF THE ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT CAPABILITY RECOMMENDED FOR GEO-CAPE IN THE 2007 NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL DECADAL SURVEY, EARTH SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS FROM SPACE: NATIONAL IMPERATIVES FOR THE NEXT DECADE AND BEYOND.  GEO-CAPE IS NOT PLANNED FOR IMPLEMENTATION THIS DECADE, HOWEVER, EUROPE (SENTINEL 4) AND ASIA (GEMS) WILL FORM PARTS OF A GLOBAL GEO CONSTELLATION FOR POLLUTION MONITORING, WITH A MAJOR FOCUS ON INTERCONTINENTAL POLLUTION TRANSPORT. TEMPO WILL LAUNCH AT A PRIME TIME TO BE A COMPONENT OF THIS CONSTELLATION."

NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION (NASA),"""IGF::OT::IGF"" OTHER FUNCTIONS - CYCLONE GLOBAL NAVIGATION SATELLITE SYSTEM (CYGNSS) MISSION - THE CYGNSS MISSION PROPOSAL WAS SELECTED UNDER THE NASA ANNOUNCEMENT OF OPPORTUNITY NNH11ZDA012O FOR THE EARTH VENTURE -2 (EV-2) ELEMENT OF THE EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE PATHFINDER (ESSP) PROGRAM OFFICES' EARTH VENTURE LINE.  THE CYGNSS MISSION IS A CLASS D SCIENCE INVESTIGATION.  THE CYGNSS MISSION GOAL IS TO UNDERSTAND THE COUPLING BETWEEN OCEAN SURFACE PROPERTIES, MOIST ATMOSPHERIC THERMODYNAMICS, RADIATION, AND CONVECTIVE DYNAMICS IN THE INNER CORE OF TROPICAL CYCLONES (TCS).  THE GOAL DIRECTLY SUPPORTS THE NASA STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE TO ENABLE IMPROVED PREDICTIVE CAPABILITY FOR WEATHER AND EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS.  NEAR-SURFACE WINDS ARE MAJOR CONTRIBUTORS TO AND INDICATORS OF MOMENTUM AND ENERGY FLUXES AT THE AIR/SEA INTERFACE.  UNDERSTANDING THE COUPLING BETWEEN THE SURFACE WINDS AND THE MOIST ATMOSPHERE WITHIN THE TC INNER CORE IS KEY TO PROPERLY MODELING AND FORECASTING ITS GENESIS AND INTENSIFICATION.  OF PARTICULAR INTEREST IS THE LACK OF SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN STORM INTENSITY FORECASTS OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES, RELATIVE TO FORECASTS OF STORM TRACK.  ADVANCES IN TRACT FORECAST HAVE RESULTED IN LARGE PART FROM THE IMPROVEMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE IN OBSERVATIONS AND MODELING OF THE MESOSCALE AND SYNOPTIC ENVIRONMENT SURROUNDING A TC.  THE HYPOTHESIS IS THAT THE LACK OF AN ACCOMPANYING IMPROVEMENT IN INTENSITY FORECAST IS LARGELY DUE TO A LACK OF OBSERVATIONS AND PROPER MODELING OF THE TC INNER CORE.  THE INADEQUACY IN OBSERVATIONS RESULTS FROM TWO CAUSES.  1.  MUCH OF THE INNER CORE OCEAN SURFACE IS OBSCURED FROM CONVENTIONAL REMOTE SENSING INSTRUMENTS BY INTENSE PRECIPITATION IN THE EYE WALL AND INNER RAIN BANDS.  2. THE RAPIDLY EVOLVING GENESIS AND INTENSIFICATION STAGES OF THE TC LIFE CYCLE ARE POORLY SAMPLED BY CONVENTIONAL POLAR-ORBITING, WIDE-SWAT IMAGERS.  CYGNSS ADDRESSES THESE TWO LIMITATIONS BY COMBINING THE ALL-WEATHER PERFORMANCE OF GPS-BASED BISTATIC SCATTEROMETRY WITH THE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL SAMPLING PROPERTIES OF A CONSTELLATION OF OBSERVATORIES.  THE CONSTELLATION CONSISTS OF INDIVIDUAL GPS SURFACE REFLECTION RECEIVERS FLOWN ON 8 NANOSATELLITES.  THIS PROVIDES THE ABILITY TO MEASURE THE OCEAN SURFACE WINDS WITH UNPRECEDENTED TEMPORAL RESOLUTION AND SPATIAL COVERAGE UNDER ALL PRECIPITATING CONDITIONS, UP TO AND INCLUDING THOSE EXPERIENCED IN THE HURRICANE EYEWALL.  CYGNSS ACHIEVES ITS GOAL USING INNOVATIVE APPLICATIONS OF EXISTING TECHNOLOGIES, LABORATORY TESTED AND VERIFIED IN A RELEVANT ENVIRONMENT, TO AVOID THE RISKS INHERENT WITH NEW TECHNOLOGIES."

NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION (NASA),"IGF::OT::IGF     TASK ORDER - STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW)  TASK TITLE: HYBRID WING BODY ENGINE/AIRFRAME OPERABILITY TESTING  1.0	INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND:  THE ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE AVIATION (ERA) PROJECT WITHIN THE INTEGRATED SYSTEMS RESEARCH PROGRAM (ISRP) OF THE NASA AERONAUTICS RESEARCH MISSION DIRECTORATE (ARMD) HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY TO EXPLORE AND DOCUMENT THE FEASIBILITY, BENEFITS, AND TECHNICAL RISK OF VEHICLE CONCEPTS AND ENABLING TECHNOLOGIES THAT WILL REDUCE THE IMPACT OF AVIATION ON THE ENVIRONMENT.  THE PRIMARY GOAL OF THE ERA PROJECT IS TO SELECT VEHICLE CONCEPTS AND TECHNOLOGIES THAT CAN SIMULTANEOUSLY REDUCE NOISE, FUEL BURN, AND EMISSIONS.  IN ADDITION, THE ERA PROJECT WILL IDENTIFY AND MITIGATE TECHNICAL RISK AND TRANSFER KNOWLEDGE TO THE AERONAUTICS COMMUNITY AT LARGE SO THAT NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND VEHICLE CONCEPTS CAN BE INCORPORATED INTO THE FUTURE DESIGN OF AIRCRAFT.  THE ERA PROJECT IS A 6-YEAR, TWO-PHASE PROJECT WITH SEVERAL INTEGRATED TECHNOLOGY DEMONSTRATION (ITD) WORK PACKAGES THAT ARE CURRENTLY DEFINED FOR PHASE II (FY13-FY15).    THE ERA PROJECT (PHASE I) CONCLUDED AN ADVANCED VEHICLE CONCEPTS (AVC) STUDY IN JANUARY 2012 UNDER NASA DRYDEN CONTRACT NND11AG03C WITH BOEING THAT IDENTIFIED ADVANCED INTEGRATED VEHICLE CONCEPTS AND COMPONENT TECHNOLOGY CONCEPTS THAT WILL ALLOW SUBSONIC TRANSPORT AIRCRAFT TO SIMULTANEOUSLY MEET THE NASA SYSTEM LEVEL GOALS OF REDUCED NOISE, EMISSIONS, AND FUEL BURN IN THE 2025 (OR BEYOND) TIMEFRAME.  BOEINGS FINAL REPORT UNDER THIS CONTRACT DEFINED A HYBRID WING BODY (HWB) PREFERRED SYSTEM CONCEPT VEHICLE THAT SIMULTANEOUSLY ACHIEVED ALL SYSTEM LEVEL GOALS.  IN THAT SYSTEM STUDY, MANY ASSUMPTIONS WERE MADE AS TO THE INSTALLATION EFFECTS OF ULTRA HIGH BYPASS RATIO (UHBR) RATIO ENGINES ON THE UPPER SURFACE OF THE VEHICLE CONCEPT.  THERE IS SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY IN MANY OF THOSE ASSUMPTIONS.  IN ADDITION, MANY OTHER IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF ENGINE AIRFRAME INTEGRATION WERE BEYOND THE SCOPE OF THE NASA DRYDEN AVC STUDY.  ISSUES LIKE INSTALLATION DRAG INCREMENTS ON VEHICLE PERFORMANCE AND FOREBODY DOMINATED FLOWS (ESPECIALLY AT LOW SPEEDS AND HIGH ANGLES OF ATTACK AND SIDESLIP) COULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE OPERABILITY OF UHBR ENGINES MOUNTED ON THE UPPER SURFACE OF HWB ADVANCED VEHICLE CONCEPTS.  THESE PROPULSION/AIRFRAME INTEGRATION (PAI) DRIVEN ISSUES MUST BE EXAMINED TO REDUCE THE UNCERTAINTY IN THE AVCS PERFORMANCE AND WILL BE THE FOCUS OF PAI EFFORTS CONDUCTED IN ERA PHASE II.     THE PLANNING PROCESS FOR ERA PROJECT PHASE II INVOLVED SEVERAL KEY DECISION POINTS WHERE VARIOUS TECHNOLOGIES WERE EVALUATED AND SOME WERE SELECTED FOR FURTHER DEVELOPMENT UNDER SEVERAL ITD WORK PACKAGES.  ONE OF THOSE ITD WORK PACKAGES GIVEN AUTHORITY TO PROCEED BY ARMD INCLUDED THE ASSESSMENT OF UHBR ENGINE OPERABILITY ON A HWB ADVANCED VEHICLE CONCEPT.  AS PART OF THIS ITD WORK PACKAGE, THE SPACE ACT AGREEMENT (SAA) SAA1-1018, ANNEX 7 PLANS TO CAPTURE A COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENT BETWEEN BOEING AND NASA.  UNDER THE SAA, BOEING WILL FURNISH THE HWB MODEL AND NASA WILL FACILITATE THE 14X22 WIND TUNNEL FOR TWO EXPERIMENT TEST CAMPAIGNS.  IN ADDITION, NASA WILL FURNISH A SET OF TURBINE-POWERED SIMULATOR SYSTEMS FOR THE TESTS.    2.0 	SCOPE&OBJECTIVE(S):  THE SCOPE OF THIS TASK ORDER IS TO DEVELOP DETAILED TEST REQUIREMENTS AND PERFORM COMPUTATIONAL ANALYSIS FOR EXPERIMENT DEVELOPMENT FOR A SUBSCALE WIND TUNNEL EXPERIMENT WITH TWO TEST CAMPAIGNS THAT NASA AND BOEING WILL CONDUCT UNDER THE SAA1-1018, ANNEX 7.  THESE TESTS ARE REQUIRED TO UNDERSTAND OPERABILITY ISSUES THAT MIGHT RESULT FROM THE PAI OF AN UHBR ENGINE ON A LOW-NOISE HWB ADVANCED VEHICLE CONFIGURATION AS WELL AS THE LOW SPEED PERFORMANCE RESULTING FROM SUCH INTEGRATION.  THE TWO TEST CAMPAIGNS ARE DESCRIBED AS FOLLOWS:      	FLOW-THRU NACELLE (FTN) AND EJECTOR TEST CAMPAIGN: AN ENGINE AIRFRAME OPERABILITY TEST AT KEY LOW SPEED OPERATING CONDITIONS FOR THE MEASUREMENT AND CHARACTERIZATION OF INLET FLOW DISTORTION AND"

NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION (NASA),"INTERSTELLAR MAPPING AND ACCELERATION PROBE (IMAP) IS A WATERSHED MISSION THAT SIMULTANEOUSLY INVESTIGATES THE ACCELERATION OF ENERGETIC PARTICLES AND INTERACTION OF THE SOLAR WIND WITH THE LOCAL INTERSTELLAR MEDIUM. IMAP WILL 1) ADVANCE THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL EVOLUTION OF THE BOUNDARY REGION IN WHICH THE SOLAR WIND AND INTERSTELLAR MEDIUM INTERACT, 2) IDENTIFY AND ADVANCE THE UNDERSTANDING OF PROCESSES RELATED TO THE INTERACTIONS OF THE MAGNETIC FIELD OF THE SUN AND THE LOCAL INTERSTELLAR MEDIUM, 3) IMPROVE THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE COMPOSITION AND PROPERTIES OF THE LOCAL INTERSTELLAR MEDIUM, AND 4) IDENTIFY AND ADVANCE THE UNDERSTANDING OF PARTICLE INJECTION AND ACCELERATION PROCESSES NEAR THE SUN, IN THE HELIOSPHERE AND HELIOSHEATH. IMAP IS BASED ON A COMPLETE AND SYNERGISTIC SET OF OBSERVATIONS. IN SITU AT 1AU, THIS REQUIRES DETAILED OBSERVATIONS OF THE SOLAR WIND ELECTRONS AND IONS SUPRATHERMAL, PICKUP, AND ENERGETIC ION POPULATIONS AND MAGNETIC FIELD. FOR THE OUTER HELIOSPHERE INTERACTION, IT REQUIRES ADVANCED GLOBAL OBSERVATIONS OF THE REMOTE PLASMA AND ENERGETIC IONS OVER A BROAD ENERGY RANGE VIA ENERGETIC NEUTRAL ATOM (ENA) IMAGING, AS WELL AS PRECISE OBSERVATION OF THE NEUTRAL INTERSTELLAR ATOMS PENETRATING THE HELIOSPHERE. COMPLEMENTARY OBSERVATIONS OF INTERSTELLAR DUST AND THE UV GLOW OF INTERSTELLAR NEUTRALS, WHILE NOT REQUIRED FOR THE THRESHOLD MISSION, ADD IMPORTANT CONTEXT AND INSIGHTS TO DEEPEN PHYSICAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE BASELINE MISSION. THESE OBSERVATIONAL NEEDS WILL REQUIRE AN INTEGRATED AND COORDINATED SUITE OF 10 INSTRUMENTS THAT SPAN BOTH THE IN SITU AND REMOTE IMAGING ASPECTS OF THE INVESTIGATION. AS THE PI INSTITUTION PRINCETON UNIVERSITY OVERSEES THE DEVELOPMENT OF IMAP TO ENSURE COST, RISK, AND SCIENCE OBJECTIVES ARE MET IN THE CONTEXT OF AN OVERALL PLAN TO DEVELOP, INTEGRATE, TEST, LAUNCH, COMMISSION, AND OPERATE THE IMAP MISSION. PRINCETON WILL DEVELOP THE SOLAR WIND AND PICKUP ION (SWAPI) INSTRUMENT, MANAGE THE MISSION SCIENCE TEAM, DEVELOP THE INTERSTELLAR DUST EXPERIMENT (IDEX) INSTRUMENT DATA PIPELINE, INITIATE THE FUTURE LEADERS PROGRAM, AND OVERSEE THE MISSION STUDENT COLLABORATION."

NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION (NASA),"IGF::OT::IGF TASK ORDER - STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW) TASK TITLE: REGULATORY COMPLIANCE IN MULTITIER SUPPLIER NETWORKS 1.0 INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND: AIRCRAFT CONSIST OF A COLLECTION OF SYSTEMS PERFORMING A WIDE VARIETY OF FUNCTIONS WITH DIFFERENT SAFETY CRITICALITY LEVELS. FOR DECADES NOW, THERE HAS BEEN AN ONGOING TREND OF INCREASING ADOPTION OF EVER MORE SOPHISTICATED COMPUTER-BASED TECHNOLOGY TO REALIZE AIRCRAFT FUNCTIONALITY. STATE-OF-THE-ART AIRCRAFT AVIONICS ARE HIGHLY COMPLEX, FUNCTIONALLY INTEGRATED, NETWORK-CENTRIC SYSTEMS OF SYSTEMS. THE DESIGN AND ANALYSIS OF DISTRIBUTED-COMPUTATION SYSTEMS LIKE THE ONES USED ON AIRCRAFT ARE INHERENTLY COMPLEX ACTIVITIES. ENSURING THAT SUCH SYSTEMS ARE SAFE AND COMPLY WITH EXISTING AIRWORTHINESS REGULATIONS IS COSTLY AND TIME-CONSUMING AS THE LEVEL OF RIGOR IN THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, ESPECIALLY THE VALIDATION AND VERIFICATION ACTIVITIES, IS DETERMINED BY CONSIDERATIONS OF SYSTEM COMPLEXITY AND SAFETY CRITICALITY. A SIGNIFICANT DEGREE OF CARE AND DEEP INSIGHT INTO THE OPERATIONAL PRINCIPLES OF THESE SYSTEMS IS REQUIRED TO ENSURE ADEQUATE COVERAGE OF ALL DESIGN IMPLICATIONS RELEVANT TO SYSTEM SAFETY. THE OVERALL COMPLEXITY OF MODERN AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS AND THE COMPLEX INTERACTIONS BETWEEN COMPONENTS (INCLUDING HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE COMPONENTS) IS NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD, ESPECIALLY UNDER FAILURE CONDITIONS. THIS COMPLEXITY IS COMPOUNDED BY CURRENT TRENDS IN THE AVIATION INDUSTRY WHERE SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT AND INTEGRATION BUSINESS MODELS USE MULTITIER NETWORKS OF SUPPLIERS, BOTH DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN. CURRENT REGULATION, POLICY AND GUIDANCE ALLOW FOR SUCH ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURES WITH A LARGE NUMBER OF PARTICIPATING COMPANIES. HOWEVER, BECAUSE THE DISTRIBUTION OF RESPONSIBILITIES AMONG MANY DISPARATE ENTITIES WITH DIFFERENT AREAS AND LEVELS OF EXPERTISE CONTINUES TO INCREASE, THERE IS A GROWING POTENTIAL THAT THE SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS MAY NOT BE COMPLETE OR CORRECT AT EVERY LEVEL OF THE DESIGN. MOREOVER, THE VALIDATION AND VERIFICATION PROCESSES MAY NOT ADEQUATELY COVER ALL POSSIBLE SOURCES AND MANNERS OF DESIGN ERRORS UNDER SUCH COMPLEX DEVELOPMENT STRUCTURES, THUS ALLOWING ERRORS OR OMISSIONS TO REMAIN EVEN AFTER FINAL CERTIFICATION APPROVAL. CERTIFICATION AUTHORITIES ACTIVELY SUPPORT THE EFFORTS BY THE AVIATION INDUSTRY BY PROVIDING FLEXIBLE WAYS OF ACHIEVING COMPLIANCE AS MORE ADVANCED SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGIES ARE DEVELOPED. NEVERTHELESS, ENSURING THAT THE SYSTEMS ARE SAFE AND COMPLY WITH THE AIRWORTHINESS REGULATIONS REMAINS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE MANUFACTURERS AND DEVELOPERS. NEW METHODS, TOOLS, PROCESSES, GUIDELINES OR REGIMENS OF OVERSIGHT MAY BE NEEDED TO PRESERVE OR IMPROVE THE LEVEL OF SAFETY IN AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS AS TECHNOLOGY AND DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES CONTINUE TO EVOLVE. THIS EFFORT SUPPORTS NASA'S AVIATION SAFETY PROGRAM S SYSTEM-WIDE SAFETY ASSURANCE TECHNOLOGIES (SSAT) PROJECT WHICH IS CONDUCTING RESEARCH DIRECTED AT IMPROVING THE SAFETY OF CURRENT AND FUTURE AIRCRAFT OPERATING IN THE NATIONAL AIRSPACE SYSTEM. UNDER SSAT THERE IS A TECHNICAL CHALLENGE THAT TARGETS THE ASSURANCE OF FLIGHT CRITICAL SYSTEMS (AFCS) A TECHNICAL CHALLENGE THAT ADDRESSES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE SOUND ASSURANCE OF SAFETY-CRITICAL DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS PROPERTIES AND THE COMPLEX INTERACTIONS BETWEEN SYSTEMS AND SUBSYSTEMS. 2.0 SCOPE&OBJECTIVE(S): 2.1 THE SCOPE OF THIS TASK ORDER IS FOR A STUDY ON THE SUBJECT OF COMPUTER-BASED AIRCRAFT SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT, SAFETY ASSURANCE, AND REGULATORY COMPLIANCE WITH MULTITIER SUPPLIER NETWORKS. THIS STUDY IS TO IDENTIFY EFFECTIVE MEANS TO ENSURE, WITH A HIGH LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE, THAT COMPUTER-BASED AIRCRAFT-LEVEL SYSTEMS ARE SAFE AND COMPLIANT WITH THE LETTER AND INTENT OF REGULATIONS AND DEVELOPMENT GUIDANCE. 2.2 THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS TASK ORDER ARE TO GENERATE A DOCUMENT THAT: DESCRIBES THE DEVELOPMENT OF MODERN COMPUTER-BASED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS OVER A MULTITIER NETWORK OF SUPPLIERS FOLLOWING RECOGNIZED DEVELOPMENT STANDA"
