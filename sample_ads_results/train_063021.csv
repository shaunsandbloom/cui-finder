THE SAME HARDWARE PROCESSOR WILL BE DEPLOYABLE IN THE AIR TRAFFIC SYSTEMS, FOR REAL-TIME DATA ANALYSIS AND DECISION-MAKING. ALL WITH MORE THAN 10X REDUCTION IN COST AND POWER CONSUMPTION. THIS DISTRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY IS BASED ON AN ANALOGCOMPUTATIONAL CORE, EXPLOITING THE MEMORY DEVICES TO CARRY OUT THE COMPUTATION AT A PHYSICAL LEVEL. ANALOG COMPUTATION IS INHERENTLY FASTER AND MORE EFFICIENT THAN THE DIGITAL ONE, WHILE THE IN-MEMORY COMPUTATION REMOVES THE DATA TRANSFER BOTTLENECK.","(853, 860, 'MENTIUM', 'PERSON')",MENTIUM,PERSON,
