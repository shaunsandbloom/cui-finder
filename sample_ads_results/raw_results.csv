NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION (NASA),"IGF::OT::IGF  SMAAART TASK ORDER SOW - REFINED AFC-ENABLED HIGH-LIFT SYSTEM INTEGRATION STUDY  1.0	INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND:  THE NASA FIXED WING (FW) PROJECT IS SEEKING TO DEMONSTRATE THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF REDUCING COMPLEXITIES ASSOCIATED WITH A MODERN HIGH-LIFT SYSTEM FOR LOW-SPEED FLIGHT CONDITIONS REPRESENTATIVE OF TAKEOFF AND LANDING WITHOUT SACRIFICING AERODYNAMIC OR ACOUSTIC PERFORMANCE.  ONE PROMISING APPROACH IS TO USE ACTIVE FLOW CONTROL (AFC) TO PROVIDE THE REQUIRED HIGH-LIFT PERFORMANCE WHILE REDUCING THE SYSTEM PART COUNT AND ASSOCIATED EXTERNAL DRAG.  NASA IS SEEKING TO EXPLORE AND EVALUATE AFC-ENABLED HIGH-LIFT SYSTEMS WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE FW PROJECT GOALS REGARDING NOISE AND FUEL BURN REDUCTIONS OF A MODERN CIVIL TRANSPORT AIRCRAFT.  MODERN HIGH-LIFT SYSTEMS ARE DESIGNED TO ALLOW A TRANSPORT AIRCRAFT WITH TYPICAL TRANSONIC CRUISE SPEEDS TO SAFELY OPERATE AT SLOW SPEEDS FOR LANDING AND TAKEOFF OPERATIONS.  THE HIGH-LIFT SYSTEM IS USUALLY SLOTTED BOTH ON THE LEADING EDGE AND THE TRAILING EDGE OF THE WING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE AERODYNAMIC PROPERTIES OF SLOTTED FLOWS AND ACHIEVE THE NECESSARY HIGH LIFT PERFORMANCE.  THE SLOTTED LEADING AND TRAILING EDGE DEVICES, AND THE ASSOCIATED SUB-SYSTEMS NECESSARY TO CHANGE THE WING CONFIGURATION FROM CRUISE TO LOW-SPEED, ARE COMPLEX AND EMPLOY A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF PARTS TO ENABLE SAFE OPERATION.  IN ADDITION, THESE COMPLEX MECHANICAL HIGH-LIFT SYSTEMS OFTEN PROTRUDE EXTERNALLY UNDER THE WINGS AND REQUIRE EXTERNAL FAIRINGS THAT RESULT IN INCREASED CRUISE DRAG.  THIS TASK ORDER BUILDS UPON WORK COMPLETED UNDER CONTRACT/TASK ORDER  NNL10AA05B/ NNL13AB65T) ENTITLED AFC-ENABLED HIGH-LIFT SYSTEM INTEGRATION STUDY, WHERE A SYSTEMS BENEFIT STUDY WAS PERFORMED ON THREE CANDIDATE AFC-ENABLED SIMPLIFIED HIGH-LIFT SYSTEMS FOR MODERN CIVIL TRANSPORTS.    FOR THIS TASK ORDER, A REFINED CONVENTIONAL HIGH-LIFT SYSTEM BASED ON THE NASA COMMON RESEARCH MODEL (CRM) WILL BE USED AS THE BASELINE FOR COMPARISON PURPOSE.

THREE MAIN FOCUS AREAS, OR TECHNICAL CHALLENGES, HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED BY NASA AND INDUSTRY AS HAVING MAJOR IMPACT ON THE CURRENT CERTIFICATION TIMELINE.  THE ACP THIRD TECHNICAL CHALLENGE (TC3), MANUFACTURING PROCESS AND SIMULATION, IS CONCERNED WITH REDUCING THE OCCURRENCE OF DEFECTS WHICH COMMONLY OCCUR IN AEROSPACE COMPOSITE STRUCTURES AS A RESULT OF THE PROCESSING METHODS UTILIZED TO FABRICATE THESE LARGE, HIGHLY COMPLEX VEHICLES.  ONE OF THE OBJECTIVES IN TC3 IS TO DEVELOP PHYSICS-BASED PROCESS MODELS WHICH ARE CAPABLE OF ACCURATELY PREDICTING THE FORMATION OF DEFECTS DURING ROBOTIC, AUTOMATED FIBER PLACEMENT (AFP) OF COMPOSITE STRUCTURE.  WHILE THE EFFICIENCY DEMONSTRATED IN AFP HAS LED TO ITS ADOPTION BY THE AEROSPACE INDUSTRY FOR FABRICATION OF AIRCRAFT FUSELAGE, WING, AND ENGINE NACELLE PRIMARY COMPOSITE STRUCTURES, THE POTENTIAL ADVANTAGES HAVE NOT BEEN FULLY REALIZED DUE TO THE OCCURRENCE OF PERFORMANCE REDUCING DEFECTS WHICH RESULT IN COSTLY AND TIME-CONSUMING REWORK.

A SMALL PRODUCT SPATIAL FOOTPRINT RESOLVES POLLUTION SOURCES AT SUB-URBAN SCALE. TOGETHER, THIS TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL RESOLUTION IMPROVES EMISSION INVENTORIES, MONITORS POPULATION EXPOSURE, AND ENABLES EFFECTIVE EMISSION-CONTROL STRATEGIES.  TEMPO TAKES ADVANTAGE OF A GEOSTATIONARY (GEO) HOST SPACECRAFT TO PROVIDE A MODEST COST MISSION THAT MEASURES THE SPECTRA REQUIRED TO RETRIEVE O3, NO2, SO2, H2CO, C2H2O2, H2O, AEROSOLS, CLOUD PARAMETERS, AND UVB RADIATION. TEMPO THUS MEASURES THE MAJOR ELEMENTS, DIRECTLY OR BY PROXY, IN THE TROPOSPHERIC O3 CHEMISTRY CYCLE. MULTI-SPECTRAL OBSERVATIONS PROVIDE SENSITIVITY TO O3 IN THE LOWERMOST TROPOSPHERE, REDUCING UNCERTAINTY IN AIR QUALITY PREDICTIONS BY 50%. TEMPO QUANTIFIES AND TRACKS THE EVOLUTION OF AEROSOL LOADING. IT PROVIDES NEAR-REAL-TIME AIR QUALITY PRODUCTS THAT WILL BE MADE WIDELY, PUBLICLY AVAILABLE.  TEMPO MAKES THE FIRST TROPOSPHERIC TRACE GAS MEASUREMENTS FROM GEO, BY BUILDING ON THE HERITAGE OF FIVE SPECTROMETERS FLOWN IN LOW-EARTH-ORBIT (LEO). THESE LEO INSTRUMENTS MEASURE THE NEEDED SPECTRA, ALTHOUGH AT COARSE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL RESOLUTIONS, TO THE PRECISIONS REQUIRED FOR TEMPO AND USE RETRIEVAL ALGORITHMS DEVELOPED FOR THEM BY TEMPO SCIENCE TEAM MEMBERS AND CURRENTLY RUNNING IN OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENTS. THIS MAKES TEMPO AN INNOVATIVE USE OF A WELL PROVEN TECHNIQUE, ABLE TO PRODUCE A REVOLUTIONARY DATASET.  TEMPO PROVIDES MUCH OF THE ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT CAPABILITY RECOMMENDED FOR GEO-CAPE IN THE 2007 NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL DECADAL SURVEY, EARTH SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS FROM SPACE: NATIONAL IMPERATIVES FOR THE NEXT DECADE AND BEYOND.  GEO-CAPE IS NOT PLANNED FOR IMPLEMENTATION THIS DECADE, HOWEVER, EUROPE (SENTINEL 4) AND ASIA (GEMS) WILL FORM PARTS OF A GLOBAL GEO CONSTELLATION FOR POLLUTION MONITORING, WITH A MAJOR FOCUS ON INTERCONTINENTAL POLLUTION TRANSPORT. TEMPO WILL LAUNCH AT A PRIME TIME TO BE A COMPONENT OF THIS CONSTELLATION.","(1908, 1911, 'LEO', 'PERSON')",LEO,PERSON,

MODIFICATIONS WILL BE MADE TO IMPROVE TIME FOCUSING AND TRANSMISSION OF THE ION SOURCE. TO IMPROVE TRANSMISSION, ION STORAGE WILL BE OPTIMIZED FOR LOWER EXTRACTION FREQUENCIES, (1-2 KHZ FROM ITS CURRENT 5 KHZ DESIGN). TO IMPROVE TIME FOCUSING, SOURCE CAPACITANCE WILL BE REDUCED AND ELECTRODE SHAPE AND POSITIONING WILL BE OPTIMIZED FOR SHARPER TIME FOCUSING. THE SOURCE SHALL BE MODIFIED TO INTERFACE DIRECTLY WITH THE GAS INLET SYSTEM (GIS), AND TO PREVENT POTENTIAL CONTAMINATION AND MEMORY EFFECTS. SOURCE HEATERS WILL BE FITTED AND SPECIAL INERT COATINGS ON THE SOURCE ELECTRODES, TO REDUCE BREAKDOWN OF LABILE COMPOUNDS ON THE SURFACES, SHALL BE TESTED. 5.1.1 ION OPTICAL SIMULATION AND OPTIMIZATION ION OPTICAL SIMULATIONS SHALL BE CARRIED OUT USING IN-HOUSE DEVELOPED SIMPLEX OPTIMIZERS TO IMPROVE THE TIME FOCUSING CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ION SOURCE AS WELL AS ION TRANSMISSION. THESE SIMULATIONS SHALL INCLUDE GRID SCATTERING EFFECTS, REALISTIC PULSER RISE-TIMES AND SPACE-CHARGE LIMITING EFFECTS. 5.1.2 REDUCTION OF THE ION SOURCE CAPACITANCE THE CONTRACTOR SHALL STUDY WAYS OF REDUCING INTERNAL AND STRAY CAPACITANCE OF THE PULSING ELEMENTS. THE REDUCED CAPACITANCE WILL IMPROVE THE EXTRACTION RISE-TIME AND REDUCE THE PULSER POWER REQUIREMENT. THESE CHANGES SHALL BE INCORPORATED INTO THE NEW SOURCE DESIGN. THE CAPACITANCE OF THE NEW SOURCE SHALL BE TESTED WITH A VECTOR IMPEDANCE METER AT THE APPROPRIATE FREQUENCY EXPECTED DURING ION EXTRACTION. 5.1.3 ION SOURCE GRID STUDY TO IMPROVE ION STORAGE THE CONTRACTOR SHALL ACCURATELY DEFINE GRID TRANSMISSIONS IN ORDER TO REDUCE FIELD PENETRATION FROM STATIC HIGH VOLTAGE ELECTRODES NEAR THE ION SOURCE VOLUME. A SIMULATION STUDY WILL BE FOLLOWED BY EXPERIMENTAL LABORATORY TESTS OF THE EFFECTS OF VARIOUS GRID TRANSMISSIONS ON THE ION STORAGE, BEAM TRANSMISSION AND TIME FOCUSING. 5.1.4 SOURCE HEATERS TO REDUCE COMPOUND MEMORY EFFECTS, SOURCE HEATERS SHALL BE DEVELOPED AND INTEGRATED, CAPABLE OF ACHIEVING AT LEAST 150 DEGREE CELSIUS SOURCE TEMPERATURES. THIS TASK WILL USE RESISTIVE METAL PATTERNED ON A CERAMIC SUBSTRATE.
